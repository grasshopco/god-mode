## Conventions Coding Conventions

The following conventions have been established for Conventions development:

### Naming Conventions
- **Variables**: camelCase (e.g., `userData`, `apiResponse`)
- **Classes**: PascalCase (e.g., `UserRepository`, `AuthService`)
- **Constants**: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `MAX_RETRY_COUNT`, `API_BASE_URL`)
- **Private members**: Prefix with underscore (e.g., `_privateMethod`, `_internalState`)

### File Organization
- One class per file
- Group related files in feature-based directories
- Keep file size under 400 lines
- Separate test files in parallel directory structure

### Code Style
- Maximum line length: 100 characters
- Indentation: 2 spaces
- Use explicit type annotations
- Always use curly braces for control structures

These conventions are enforced through linting and code reviews.

## Conventions Documentation Standards

Documentation standards for Conventions have been updated:

### Code Documentation
- All public APIs must have JSDoc comments
- Include examples for non-obvious usage
- Document exceptions and error conditions
- Keep comments up-to-date with code changes

### Project Documentation
- README.md with setup instructions
- CONTRIBUTING.md with contribution guidelines
- ARCHITECTURE.md with system overview
- API.md with endpoint documentation

### Commit Messages
- Follow conventional commits format
- Reference issue numbers when applicable
- Include context for future readers
- Keep subject line under 72 characters

These standards ensure knowledge transfer and maintenance efficiency.

The project now uses a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns.
Each module follows the repository pattern with standard naming conventions.
```

This will route the content to:
- MEMORY_CURSOR.md
- memory_architecture.md
- memory_conventions.md

### Example 2: Route to Logs and Features

Tracking System: The routing tracking system is working correctly, showing a history of recent routing operations including:
What content was routed
Which file it was routed to
When it was routed
The line number where the content was added
Debug Output: The debug logs show the message router correctly identified and processed all tags in our test message.
The system has some non-critical issues to note:
Desktop Notifications: There are errors with the notification system (plyer notification failed), but the script falls back to console notifications as designed.
Pattern Matching: Some standard patterns show "Standard match doesn't have enough groups" warnings, but this doesn't prevent content from being routed correctly.
Since the routing history shows our content was properly routed, and we can see the feature log file was created with the correct content, we can confirm that the message router is working correctly.
If you'd like, we can run another test with different tag types or make improvements to the notification system to resolve those errors.
It says that the Cursor watch is not working. Also, you didn't do the tags again meaning that you didn't run the script before you started. I think in your Cursor rules file you literally need to have instructions that tell you to run a script. And also you didn't run the script at the end of the response of yours or at least you didn't give me the option to run the script. And also you didn't do the get commit auto. And furthermore, we need to think about this because if I keep interacting with you in the chat and that's what's causing you to F up and I need to interact with you through the CLI so this doesn't keep happening like if in the CLI stuff is being done in a more controlled manner to make sure that everything is being run properly every single time such as like when I do a certain command in the CLI it also attaches to a script that makes your response to go a certain way an flow and do everything that I want from the beginning all the way to the end till it goes and offers up to run the script or even auto runs the script for the looking back at your message and seeing all the tags and also doing the auto GIT commit

You're absolutely right. There are several critical issues that need to be fixed immediately:

Let me try again with a more explicit edit:
There's something strange here. The code actually looks properly indented in the file, but the error message is still showing an indentation error. Let me try to completely rewrite this section of the file:

Let's try a different approach. Let's create a completely new version of the script:

And furthermore, we need to think about this because if I keep interacting with you in the chat and that's what's causing you to F up and I need to interact with you through the CLI so this doesn't keep happening like if in the CLI stuff is being done in a more controlled manner to make sure that everything is being run properly every single time such as like when I do a certain command in the CLI it also attaches to a script that makes your response to go a certain way an flow and do everything that I want from the beginning all the way to the end till it goes and offers up to run the script or even auto runs the script for the looking back at your message and seeing all the tags and also doing the auto GIT commit

Thought Process
You're absolutely right. There are several critical issues that need to be fixed immediately:
I see the indentation error. Let me fix the Cursor Watch script:
.
Let me try again with a more explicit edit:
There's something strange here. The code actually looks properly indented in the file, but the error message is still showing an indentation error. Let me try to completely rewrite this section of the file:
.
Let's try a different approach. Let's create a completely new version of the script:
Now let's create an auto-commit script for Git integration:
Let's create a .gitignore file to exclude unnecessary files:
Let's try creating the .gitignore without newlines:
Let's create the auto-commit script:
Let's create the auto-commit script file by file:
Let's make the script executable:
Now, let's update the README to include information about auto-commit functionality:
Now, let's update the god_mode_remote.sh script to include auto-commit as part of its workflow:
Let's see if the auto-commit functionality is already integrated into the case statement:
Let's look for the main switch case in the script:
Let's search for the auto-commit implementation:
Let's look at the auto-commit function in the remote script:
Now, let's update the Cursor rules file to ensure that the AI adds

tag successfully routed the same content to both the architecture and conventions memory files.
Tracking System: The routing tracking system is working correctly, showing a history of recent routing operations including:
What content was routed
Which file it was routed to
When it was routed
The line number where the content was added
Debug Output: The debug logs show the message router correctly identified and processed all tags in our test message.
The system has some non-critical issues to note:
Desktop Notifications: There are errors with the notification system (plyer notification failed), but the script falls back to console notifications as designed.
Pattern Matching: Some standard patterns show "Standard match doesn't have enough groups" warnings, but this doesn't prevent content from being routed correctly.
Since the routing history shows our content was properly routed, and we can see the feature log file was created with the correct content, we can confirm that the message router is working correctly.
If you'd like, we can run another test with different tag types or make improvements to the notification system to resolve those errors.

Debug Output: The debug logs show the message router correctly identified and processed all tags in our test message.
The system has some non-critical issues to note:
Desktop Notifications: There are errors with the notification system (plyer notification failed), but the script falls back to console notifications as designed.
Pattern Matching: Some standard patterns show "Standard match doesn't have enough groups" warnings, but this doesn't prevent content from being routed correctly.
Since the routing history shows our content was properly routed, and we can see the feature log file was created with the correct content, we can confirm that the message router is working correctly.
If you'd like, we can run another test with different tag types or make improvements to the notification system to resolve those errors.
It says that the Cursor watch is not working. Also, you didn't do the tags again meaning that you didn't run the script before you started. I think in your Cursor rules file you literally need to have instructions that tell you to run a script. And also you didn't run the script at the end of the response of yours or at least you didn't give me the option to run the script. And also you didn't do the get commit auto. And furthermore, we need to think about this because if I keep interacting with you in the chat and that's what's causing you to F up and I need to interact with you through the CLI so this doesn't keep happening like if in the CLI stuff is being done in a more controlled manner to make sure that everything is being run properly every single time such as like when I do a certain command in the CLI it also attaches to a script that makes your response to go a certain way an flow and do everything that I want from the beginning all the way to the end till it goes and offers up to run the script or even auto runs the script for the looking back at your message and seeing all the tags and also doing the auto GIT commit

tag successfully routed the same content to both the architecture and conventions memory files.
Tracking System: The routing tracking system is working correctly, showing a history of recent routing operations including:
What content was routed
Which file it was routed to
When it was routed
The line number where the content was added
Debug Output: The debug logs show the message router correctly identified and processed all tags in our test message.
The system has some non-critical issues to note:
Desktop Notifications: There are errors with the notification system (plyer notification failed), but the script falls back to console notifications as designed.
Pattern Matching: Some standard patterns show "Standard match doesn't have enough groups" warnings, but this doesn't prevent content from being routed correctly.
Since the routing history shows our content was properly routed, and we can see the feature log file was created with the correct content, we can confirm that the message router is working correctly.
If you'd like, we can run another test with different tag types or make improvements to the notification system to resolve those errors.
It says that the Cursor watch is not working. Also, you didn't do the tags again meaning that you didn't run the script before you started. I think in your Cursor rules file you literally need to have instructions that tell you to run a script. And also you didn't run the script at the end of the response of yours or at least you didn't give me the option to run the script. And also you didn't do the get commit auto. And furthermore, we need to think about this because if I keep interacting with you in the chat and that's what's causing you to F up and I need to interact with you through the CLI so this doesn't keep happening like if in the CLI stuff is being done in a more controlled manner to make sure that everything is being run properly every single time such as like when I do a certain command in the CLI it also attaches to a script that makes your response to go a certain way an flow and do everything that I want from the beginning all the way to the end till it goes and offers up to run the script or even auto runs the script for the looking back at your message and seeing all the tags and also doing the auto GIT commit

You're absolutely right. There are several critical issues that need to be fixed immediately:

Let me try again with a more explicit edit:
There's something strange here. The code actually looks properly indented in the file, but the error message is still showing an indentation error. Let me try to completely rewrite this section of the file:
.
Let's try a different approach. Let's create a completely new version of the script:
Now let's create an auto-commit script for Git integration:
Let's create a .gitignore file to exclude unnecessary files:
Let's try creating the .gitignore without newlines:
Let's create the auto-commit script:
Let's create the auto-commit script file by file:
Let's make the script executable:
Now, let's update the README to include information about auto-commit functionality:
Now, let's update the god_mode_remote.sh script to include auto-commit as part of its workflow:
Let's see if the auto-commit functionality is already integrated into the case statement:
Let's look for the main switch case in the script:
Let's search for the auto-commit implementation:
Let's look at the auto-commit function in the remote script:

tag successfully routed the same content to both the architecture and conventions memory files.
Tracking System: The routing tracking system is working correctly, showing a history of recent routing operations including:
What content was routed
Which file it was routed to
When it was routed
The line number where the content was added
Debug Output: The debug logs show the message router correctly identified and processed all tags in our test message.
The system has some non-critical issues to note:
Desktop Notifications: There are errors with the notification system (plyer notification failed), but the script falls back to console notifications as designed.
Pattern Matching: Some standard patterns show "Standard match doesn't have enough groups" warnings, but this doesn't prevent content from being routed correctly.
Since the routing history shows our content was properly routed, and we can see the feature log file was created with the correct content, we can confirm that the message router is working correctly.
If you'd like, we can run another test with different tag types or make improvements to the notification system to resolve those errors.
It says that the Cursor watch is not working. Also, you didn't do the tags again meaning that you didn't run the script before you started. I think in your Cursor rules file you literally need to have instructions that tell you to run a script. And also you didn't run the script at the end of the response of yours or at least you didn't give me the option to run the script. And also you didn't do the get commit auto. And furthermore, we need to think about this because if I keep interacting with you in the chat and that's what's causing you to F up and I need to interact with you through the CLI so this doesn't keep happening like if in the CLI stuff is being done in a more controlled manner to make sure that everything is being run properly every single time such as like when I do a certain command in the CLI it also attaches to a script that makes your response to go a certain way an flow and do everything that I want from the beginning all the way to the end till it goes and offers up to run the script or even auto runs the script for the looking back at your message and seeing all the tags and also doing the auto GIT commit

Let's try a different approach. Let's create a completely new version of the script:
Now let's create an auto-commit script for Git integration:
Let's create a .gitignore file to exclude unnecessary files:
Let's try creating the .gitignore without newlines:
Let's create the auto-commit script:

Let's see if the auto-commit functionality is already integrated into the case statement:
Let's look for the main switch case in the script:
Let's search for the auto-commit implementation:
Let's look at the auto-commit function in the remote script:

tag successfully routed the same content to both the architecture and conventions memory files.
Tracking System: The routing tracking system is working correctly, showing a history of recent routing operations including:
What content was routed
Which file it was routed to
When it was routed
The line number where the content was added
Debug Output: The debug logs show the message router correctly identified and processed all tags in our test message.
The system has some non-critical issues to note:
Desktop Notifications: There are errors with the notification system (plyer notification failed), but the script falls back to console notifications as designed.
Pattern Matching: Some standard patterns show "Standard match doesn't have enough groups" warnings, but this doesn't prevent content from being routed correctly.
Since the routing history shows our content was properly routed, and we can see the feature log file was created with the correct content, we can confirm that the message router is working correctly.
If you'd like, we can run another test with different tag types or make improvements to the notification system to resolve those errors.
It says that the Cursor watch is not working. Also, you didn't do the tags again meaning that you didn't run the script before you started. I think in your Cursor rules file you literally need to have instructions that tell you to run a script. And also you didn't run the script at the end of the response of yours or at least you didn't give me the option to run the script. And also you didn't do the get commit auto. And furthermore, we need to think about this because if I keep interacting with you in the chat and that's what's causing you to F up and I need to interact with you through the CLI so this doesn't keep happening like if in the CLI stuff is being done in a more controlled manner to make sure that everything is being run properly every single time such as like when I do a certain command in the CLI it also attaches to a script that makes your response to go a certain way an flow and do everything that I want from the beginning all the way to the end till it goes and offers up to run the script or even auto runs the script for the looking back at your message and seeing all the tags and also doing the auto GIT commit

tag successfully routed the same content to both the architecture and conventions memory files.
Tracking System: The routing tracking system is working correctly, showing a history of recent routing operations including:
What content was routed
Which file it was routed to
When it was routed
The line number where the content was added
Debug Output: The debug logs show the message router correctly identified and processed all tags in our test message.
The system has some non-critical issues to note:
Desktop Notifications: There are errors with the notification system (plyer notification failed), but the script falls back to console notifications as designed.
Pattern Matching: Some standard patterns show "Standard match doesn't have enough groups" warnings, but this doesn't prevent content from being routed correctly.
Since the routing history shows our content was properly routed, and we can see the feature log file was created with the correct content, we can confirm that the message router is working correctly.
If you'd like, we can run another test with different tag types or make improvements to the notification system to resolve those errors.
It says that the Cursor watch is not working. Also, you didn't do the tags again meaning that you didn't run the script before you started. I think in your Cursor rules file you literally need to have instructions that tell you to run a script. And also you didn't run the script at the end of the response of yours or at least you didn't give me the option to run the script. And also you didn't do the get commit auto. And furthermore, we need to think about this because if I keep interacting with you in the chat and that's what's causing you to F up and I need to interact with you through the CLI so this doesn't keep happening like if in the CLI stuff is being done in a more controlled manner to make sure that everything is being run properly every single time such as like when I do a certain command in the CLI it also attaches to a script that makes your response to go a certain way an flow and do everything that I want from the beginning all the way to the end till it goes and offers up to run the script or even auto runs the script for the looking back at your message and seeing all the tags and also doing the auto GIT commit

tag successfully routed the same content to both the architecture and conventions memory files.
Tracking System: The routing tracking system is working correctly, showing a history of recent routing operations including:
What content was routed
Which file it was routed to
When it was routed
The line number where the content was added
Debug Output: The debug logs show the message router correctly identified and processed all tags in our test message.
The system has some non-critical issues to note:
Desktop Notifications: There are errors with the notification system (plyer notification failed), but the script falls back to console notifications as designed.
Pattern Matching: Some standard patterns show "Standard match doesn't have enough groups" warnings, but this doesn't prevent content from being routed correctly.
Since the routing history shows our content was properly routed, and we can see the feature log file was created with the correct content, we can confirm that the message router is working correctly.
If you'd like, we can run another test with different tag types or make improvements to the notification system to resolve those errors.

Debug Output: The debug logs show the message router correctly identified and processed all tags in our test message.
The system has some non-critical issues to note:
Desktop Notifications: There are errors with the notification system (plyer notification failed), but the script falls back to console notifications as designed.
Pattern Matching: Some standard patterns show "Standard match doesn't have enough groups" warnings, but this doesn't prevent content from being routed correctly.
Since the routing history shows our content was properly routed, and we can see the feature log file was created with the correct content, we can confirm that the message router is working correctly.
If you'd like, we can run another test with different tag types or make improvements to the notification system to resolve those errors.
It says that the Cursor watch is not working. Also, you didn't do the tags again meaning that you didn't run the script before you started. I think in your Cursor rules file you literally need to have instructions that tell you to run a script. And also you didn't run the script at the end of the response of yours or at least you didn't give me the option to run the script. And also you didn't do the get commit auto. And furthermore, we need to think about this because if I keep interacting with you in the chat and that's what's causing you to F up and I need to interact with you through the CLI so this doesn't keep happening like if in the CLI stuff is being done in a more controlled manner to make sure that everything is being run properly every single time such as like when I do a certain command in the CLI it also attaches to a script that makes your response to go a certain way an flow and do everything that I want from the beginning all the way to the end till it goes and offers up to run the script or even auto runs the script for the looking back at your message and seeing all the tags and also doing the auto GIT commit

Let's try a different approach. Let's create a completely new version of the script:

tag successfully routed the same content to both the architecture and conventions memory files.
Tracking System: The routing tracking system is working correctly, showing a history of recent routing operations including:
What content was routed
Which file it was routed to
When it was routed
The line number where the content was added
Debug Output: The debug logs show the message router correctly identified and processed all tags in our test message.
The system has some non-critical issues to note:
Desktop Notifications: There are errors with the notification system (plyer notification failed), but the script falls back to console notifications as designed.
Pattern Matching: Some standard patterns show "Standard match doesn't have enough groups" warnings, but this doesn't prevent content from being routed correctly.
Since the routing history shows our content was properly routed, and we can see the feature log file was created with the correct content, we can confirm that the message router is working correctly.
If you'd like, we can run another test with different tag types or make improvements to the notification system to resolve those errors.
It says that the Cursor watch is not working. Also, you didn't do the tags again meaning that you didn't run the script before you started. I think in your Cursor rules file you literally need to have instructions that tell you to run a script. And also you didn't run the script at the end of the response of yours or at least you didn't give me the option to run the script. And also you didn't do the get commit auto. And furthermore, we need to think about this because if I keep interacting with you in the chat and that's what's causing you to F up and I need to interact with you through the CLI so this doesn't keep happening like if in the CLI stuff is being done in a more controlled manner to make sure that everything is being run properly every single time such as like when I do a certain command in the CLI it also attaches to a script that makes your response to go a certain way an flow and do everything that I want from the beginning all the way to the end till it goes and offers up to run the script or even auto runs the script for the looking back at your message and seeing all the tags and also doing the auto GIT commit

You're absolutely right. There are several critical issues that need to be fixed immediately:

Let me try again with a more explicit edit:
There's something strange here. The code actually looks properly indented in the file, but the error message is still showing an indentation error. Let me try to completely rewrite this section of the file:
.
Let's try a different approach. Let's create a completely new version of the script:
Now let's create an auto-commit script for Git integration:
Let's create a .gitignore file to exclude unnecessary files:
Let's try creating the .gitignore without newlines:
Let's create the auto-commit script:
Let's create the auto-commit script file by file:
Let's make the script executable:
Now, let's update the README to include information about auto-commit functionality:
Now, let's update the god_mode_remote.sh script to include auto-commit as part of its workflow:
Let's see if the auto-commit functionality is already integrated into the case statement:
Let's look for the main switch case in the script:
Let's search for the auto-commit implementation:
Let's look at the auto-commit function in the remote script:

tag successfully routed the same content to both the architecture and conventions memory files.
Tracking System: The routing tracking system is working correctly, showing a history of recent routing operations including:
What content was routed
Which file it was routed to
When it was routed
The line number where the content was added
Debug Output: The debug logs show the message router correctly identified and processed all tags in our test message.
The system has some non-critical issues to note:
Desktop Notifications: There are errors with the notification system (plyer notification failed), but the script falls back to console notifications as designed.
Pattern Matching: Some standard patterns show "Standard match doesn't have enough groups" warnings, but this doesn't prevent content from being routed correctly.
Since the routing history shows our content was properly routed, and we can see the feature log file was created with the correct content, we can confirm that the message router is working correctly.
If you'd like, we can run another test with different tag types or make improvements to the notification system to resolve those errors.
It says that the Cursor watch is not working. Also, you didn't do the tags again meaning that you didn't run the script before you started. I think in your Cursor rules file you literally need to have instructions that tell you to run a script. And also you didn't run the script at the end of the response of yours or at least you didn't give me the option to run the script. And also you didn't do the get commit auto. And furthermore, we need to think about this because if I keep interacting with you in the chat and that's what's causing you to F up and I need to interact with you through the CLI so this doesn't keep happening like if in the CLI stuff is being done in a more controlled manner to make sure that everything is being run properly every single time such as like when I do a certain command in the CLI it also attaches to a script that makes your response to go a certain way an flow and do everything that I want from the beginning all the way to the end till it goes and offers up to run the script or even auto runs the script for the looking back at your message and seeing all the tags and also doing the auto GIT commit

You're absolutely right. There are several critical issues that need to be fixed immediately:

Let's try a different approach. Let's create a completely new version of the script:
Now let's create an auto-commit script for Git integration:
Let's create a .gitignore file to exclude unnecessary files:
Let's try creating the .gitignore without newlines:
Let's create the auto-commit script:
Let's create the auto-commit script file by file:
Let's make the script executable:
Now, let's update the README to include information about auto-commit functionality:

Let's see if the auto-commit functionality is already integrated into the case statement:
Let's look for the main switch case in the script:
Let's search for the auto-commit implementation:
Let's look at the auto-commit function in the remote script:

tag successfully routed the same content to both the architecture and conventions memory files.
Tracking System: The routing tracking system is working correctly, showing a history of recent routing operations including:
What content was routed
Which file it was routed to
When it was routed
The line number where the content was added
Debug Output: The debug logs show the message router correctly identified and processed all tags in our test message.
The system has some non-critical issues to note:
Desktop Notifications: There are errors with the notification system (plyer notification failed), but the script falls back to console notifications as designed.
Pattern Matching: Some standard patterns show "Standard match doesn't have enough groups" warnings, but this doesn't prevent content from being routed correctly.
Since the routing history shows our content was properly routed, and we can see the feature log file was created with the correct content, we can confirm that the message router is working correctly.
If you'd like, we can run another test with different tag types or make improvements to the notification system to resolve those errors.
It says that the Cursor watch is not working. Also, you didn't do the tags again meaning that you didn't run the script before you started. I think in your Cursor rules file you literally need to have instructions that tell you to run a script. And also you didn't run the script at the end of the response of yours or at least you didn't give me the option to run the script. And also you didn't do the get commit auto. And furthermore, we need to think about this because if I keep interacting with you in the chat and that's what's causing you to F up and I need to interact with you through the CLI so this doesn't keep happening like if in the CLI stuff is being done in a more controlled manner to make sure that everything is being run properly every single time such as like when I do a certain command in the CLI it also attaches to a script that makes your response to go a certain way an flow and do everything that I want from the beginning all the way to the end till it goes and offers up to run the script or even auto runs the script for the looking back at your message and seeing all the tags and also doing the auto GIT commit

tag successfully routed the same content to both the architecture and conventions memory files.
Tracking System: The routing tracking system is working correctly, showing a history of recent routing operations including:
What content was routed
Which file it was routed to
When it was routed
The line number where the content was added
Debug Output: The debug logs show the message router correctly identified and processed all tags in our test message.
The system has some non-critical issues to note:
Desktop Notifications: There are errors with the notification system (plyer notification failed), but the script falls back to console notifications as designed.
Pattern Matching: Some standard patterns show "Standard match doesn't have enough groups" warnings, but this doesn't prevent content from being routed correctly.
Since the routing history shows our content was properly routed, and we can see the feature log file was created with the correct content, we can confirm that the message router is working correctly.
If you'd like, we can run another test with different tag types or make improvements to the notification system to resolve those errors.
It says that the Cursor watch is not working. Also, you didn't do the tags again meaning that you didn't run the script before you started. I think in your Cursor rules file you literally need to have instructions that tell you to run a script. And also you didn't run the script at the end of the response of yours or at least you didn't give me the option to run the script. And also you didn't do the get commit auto. And furthermore, we need to think about this because if I keep interacting with you in the chat and that's what's causing you to F up and I need to interact with you through the CLI so this doesn't keep happening like if in the CLI stuff is being done in a more controlled manner to make sure that everything is being run properly every single time such as like when I do a certain command in the CLI it also attaches to a script that makes your response to go a certain way an flow and do everything that I want from the beginning all the way to the end till it goes and offers up to run the script or even auto runs the script for the looking back at your message and seeing all the tags and also doing the auto GIT commit

tag successfully routed the same content to both the architecture and conventions memory files.
Tracking System: The routing tracking system is working correctly, showing a history of recent routing operations including:
What content was routed
Which file it was routed to
When it was routed
The line number where the content was added
Debug Output: The debug logs show the message router correctly identified and processed all tags in our test message.
The system has some non-critical issues to note:
Desktop Notifications: There are errors with the notification system (plyer notification failed), but the script falls back to console notifications as designed.
Pattern Matching: Some standard patterns show "Standard match doesn't have enough groups" warnings, but this doesn't prevent content from being routed correctly.
Since the routing history shows our content was properly routed, and we can see the feature log file was created with the correct content, we can confirm that the message router is working correctly.
If you'd like, we can run another test with different tag types or make improvements to the notification system to resolve those errors.

Debug Output: The debug logs show the message router correctly identified and processed all tags in our test message.
The system has some non-critical issues to note:
Desktop Notifications: There are errors with the notification system (plyer notification failed), but the script falls back to console notifications as designed.
Pattern Matching: Some standard patterns show "Standard match doesn't have enough groups" warnings, but this doesn't prevent content from being routed correctly.
Since the routing history shows our content was properly routed, and we can see the feature log file was created with the correct content, we can confirm that the message router is working correctly.
If you'd like, we can run another test with different tag types or make improvements to the notification system to resolve those errors.
It says that the Cursor watch is not working. Also, you didn't do the tags again meaning that you didn't run the script before you started. I think in your Cursor rules file you literally need to have instructions that tell you to run a script. And also you didn't run the script at the end of the response of yours or at least you didn't give me the option to run the script. And also you didn't do the get commit auto. And furthermore, we need to think about this because if I keep interacting with you in the chat and that's what's causing you to F up and I need to interact with you through the CLI so this doesn't keep happening like if in the CLI stuff is being done in a more controlled manner to make sure that everything is being run properly every single time such as like when I do a certain command in the CLI it also attaches to a script that makes your response to go a certain way an flow and do everything that I want from the beginning all the way to the end till it goes and offers up to run the script or even auto runs the script for the looking back at your message and seeing all the tags and also doing the auto GIT commit

Let's try a different approach. Let's create a completely new version of the script:

tag successfully routed the same content to both the architecture and conventions memory files.
Tracking System: The routing tracking system is working correctly, showing a history of recent routing operations including:
What content was routed
Which file it was routed to
When it was routed
The line number where the content was added
Debug Output: The debug logs show the message router correctly identified and processed all tags in our test message.
The system has some non-critical issues to note:
Desktop Notifications: There are errors with the notification system (plyer notification failed), but the script falls back to console notifications as designed.
Pattern Matching: Some standard patterns show "Standard match doesn't have enough groups" warnings, but this doesn't prevent content from being routed correctly.
Since the routing history shows our content was properly routed, and we can see the feature log file was created with the correct content, we can confirm that the message router is working correctly.
If you'd like, we can run another test with different tag types or make improvements to the notification system to resolve those errors.
It says that the Cursor watch is not working. Also, you didn't do the tags again meaning that you didn't run the script before you started. I think in your Cursor rules file you literally need to have instructions that tell you to run a script. And also you didn't run the script at the end of the response of yours or at least you didn't give me the option to run the script. And also you didn't do the get commit auto. And furthermore, we need to think about this because if I keep interacting with you in the chat and that's what's causing you to F up and I need to interact with you through the CLI so this doesn't keep happening like if in the CLI stuff is being done in a more controlled manner to make sure that everything is being run properly every single time such as like when I do a certain command in the CLI it also attaches to a script that makes your response to go a certain way an flow and do everything that I want from the beginning all the way to the end till it goes and offers up to run the script or even auto runs the script for the looking back at your message and seeing all the tags and also doing the auto GIT commit

You're absolutely right. There are several critical issues that need to be fixed immediately:

Let me try again with a more explicit edit:
There's something strange here. The code actually looks properly indented in the file, but the error message is still showing an indentation error. Let me try to completely rewrite this section of the file:

Let's try a different approach. Let's create a completely new version of the script:
Now let's create an auto-commit script for Git integration:
Let's create a .gitignore file to exclude unnecessary files:
Let's try creating the .gitignore without newlines:
Let's create the auto-commit script:
Let's create the auto-commit script file by file:
Let's make the script executable:
Now, let's update the README to include information about auto-commit functionality:
Now, let's update the god_mode_remote.sh script to include auto-commit as part of its workflow:
Let's see if the auto-commit functionality is already integrated into the case statement:
Let's look for the main switch case in the script:
Let's search for the auto-commit implementation:
Let's look at the auto-commit function in the remote script:

tag successfully routed the same content to both the architecture and conventions memory files.
Tracking System: The routing tracking system is working correctly, showing a history of recent routing operations including:
What content was routed
Which file it was routed to
When it was routed
The line number where the content was added
Debug Output: The debug logs show the message router correctly identified and processed all tags in our test message.
The system has some non-critical issues to note:
Desktop Notifications: There are errors with the notification system (plyer notification failed), but the script falls back to console notifications as designed.
Pattern Matching: Some standard patterns show "Standard match doesn't have enough groups" warnings, but this doesn't prevent content from being routed correctly.
Since the routing history shows our content was properly routed, and we can see the feature log file was created with the correct content, we can confirm that the message router is working correctly.
If you'd like, we can run another test with different tag types or make improvements to the notification system to resolve those errors.
It says that the Cursor watch is not working. Also, you didn't do the tags again meaning that you didn't run the script before you started. I think in your Cursor rules file you literally need to have instructions that tell you to run a script. And also you didn't run the script at the end of the response of yours or at least you didn't give me the option to run the script. And also you didn't do the get commit auto. And furthermore, we need to think about this because if I keep interacting with you in the chat and that's what's causing you to F up and I need to interact with you through the CLI so this doesn't keep happening like if in the CLI stuff is being done in a more controlled manner to make sure that everything is being run properly every single time such as like when I do a certain command in the CLI it also attaches to a script that makes your response to go a certain way an flow and do everything that I want from the beginning all the way to the end till it goes and offers up to run the script or even auto runs the script for the looking back at your message and seeing all the tags and also doing the auto GIT commit

Let's try a different approach. Let's create a completely new version of the script:
Now let's create an auto-commit script for Git integration:
Let's create a .gitignore file to exclude unnecessary files:
Let's try creating the .gitignore without newlines:
Let's create the auto-commit script:

Let's see if the auto-commit functionality is already integrated into the case statement:
Let's look for the main switch case in the script:
Let's search for the auto-commit implementation:
Let's look at the auto-commit function in the remote script:

tag successfully routed the same content to both the architecture and conventions memory files.
Tracking System: The routing tracking system is working correctly, showing a history of recent routing operations including:
What content was routed
Which file it was routed to
When it was routed
The line number where the content was added
Debug Output: The debug logs show the message router correctly identified and processed all tags in our test message.
The system has some non-critical issues to note:
Desktop Notifications: There are errors with the notification system (plyer notification failed), but the script falls back to console notifications as designed.
Pattern Matching: Some standard patterns show "Standard match doesn't have enough groups" warnings, but this doesn't prevent content from being routed correctly.
Since the routing history shows our content was properly routed, and we can see the feature log file was created with the correct content, we can confirm that the message router is working correctly.
If you'd like, we can run another test with different tag types or make improvements to the notification system to resolve those errors.
It says that the Cursor watch is not working. Also, you didn't do the tags again meaning that you didn't run the script before you started. I think in your Cursor rules file you literally need to have instructions that tell you to run a script. And also you didn't run the script at the end of the response of yours or at least you didn't give me the option to run the script. And also you didn't do the get commit auto. And furthermore, we need to think about this because if I keep interacting with you in the chat and that's what's causing you to F up and I need to interact with you through the CLI so this doesn't keep happening like if in the CLI stuff is being done in a more controlled manner to make sure that everything is being run properly every single time such as like when I do a certain command in the CLI it also attaches to a script that makes your response to go a certain way an flow and do everything that I want from the beginning all the way to the end till it goes and offers up to run the script or even auto runs the script for the looking back at your message and seeing all the tags and also doing the auto GIT commit

tag successfully routed the same content to both the architecture and conventions memory files.
Tracking System: The routing tracking system is working correctly, showing a history of recent routing operations including:
What content was routed
Which file it was routed to
When it was routed
The line number where the content was added
Debug Output: The debug logs show the message router correctly identified and processed all tags in our test message.
The system has some non-critical issues to note:
Desktop Notifications: There are errors with the notification system (plyer notification failed), but the script falls back to console notifications as designed.
Pattern Matching: Some standard patterns show "Standard match doesn't have enough groups" warnings, but this doesn't prevent content from being routed correctly.
Since the routing history shows our content was properly routed, and we can see the feature log file was created with the correct content, we can confirm that the message router is working correctly.
If you'd like, we can run another test with different tag types or make improvements to the notification system to resolve those errors.
It says that the Cursor watch is not working. Also, you didn't do the tags again meaning that you didn't run the script before you started. I think in your Cursor rules file you literally need to have instructions that tell you to run a script. And also you didn't run the script at the end of the response of yours or at least you didn't give me the option to run the script. And also you didn't do the get commit auto. And furthermore, we need to think about this because if I keep interacting with you in the chat and that's what's causing you to F up and I need to interact with you through the CLI so this doesn't keep happening like if in the CLI stuff is being done in a more controlled manner to make sure that everything is being run properly every single time such as like when I do a certain command in the CLI it also attaches to a script that makes your response to go a certain way an flow and do everything that I want from the beginning all the way to the end till it goes and offers up to run the script or even auto runs the script for the looking back at your message and seeing all the tags and also doing the auto GIT commit

tag successfully routed the same content to both the architecture and conventions memory files.
Tracking System: The routing tracking system is working correctly, showing a history of recent routing operations including:
What content was routed
Which file it was routed to
When it was routed
The line number where the content was added
Debug Output: The debug logs show the message router correctly identified and processed all tags in our test message.
The system has some non-critical issues to note:
Desktop Notifications: There are errors with the notification system (plyer notification failed), but the script falls back to console notifications as designed.
Pattern Matching: Some standard patterns show "Standard match doesn't have enough groups" warnings, but this doesn't prevent content from being routed correctly.
Since the routing history shows our content was properly routed, and we can see the feature log file was created with the correct content, we can confirm that the message router is working correctly.
If you'd like, we can run another test with different tag types or make improvements to the notification system to resolve those errors.

Debug Output: The debug logs show the message router correctly identified and processed all tags in our test message.
The system has some non-critical issues to note:
Desktop Notifications: There are errors with the notification system (plyer notification failed), but the script falls back to console notifications as designed.
Pattern Matching: Some standard patterns show "Standard match doesn't have enough groups" warnings, but this doesn't prevent content from being routed correctly.
Since the routing history shows our content was properly routed, and we can see the feature log file was created with the correct content, we can confirm that the message router is working correctly.
If you'd like, we can run another test with different tag types or make improvements to the notification system to resolve those errors.
It says that the Cursor watch is not working. Also, you didn't do the tags again meaning that you didn't run the script before you started. I think in your Cursor rules file you literally need to have instructions that tell you to run a script. And also you didn't run the script at the end of the response of yours or at least you didn't give me the option to run the script. And also you didn't do the get commit auto. And furthermore, we need to think about this because if I keep interacting with you in the chat and that's what's causing you to F up and I need to interact with you through the CLI so this doesn't keep happening like if in the CLI stuff is being done in a more controlled manner to make sure that everything is being run properly every single time such as like when I do a certain command in the CLI it also attaches to a script that makes your response to go a certain way an flow and do everything that I want from the beginning all the way to the end till it goes and offers up to run the script or even auto runs the script for the looking back at your message and seeing all the tags and also doing the auto GIT commit

Let's try a different approach. Let's create a completely new version of the script:

tag successfully routed the same content to both the architecture and conventions memory files.
Tracking System: The routing tracking system is working correctly, showing a history of recent routing operations including:
What content was routed
Which file it was routed to
When it was routed
The line number where the content was added
Debug Output: The debug logs show the message router correctly identified and processed all tags in our test message.
The system has some non-critical issues to note:
Desktop Notifications: There are errors with the notification system (plyer notification failed), but the script falls back to console notifications as designed.
Pattern Matching: Some standard patterns show "Standard match doesn't have enough groups" warnings, but this doesn't prevent content from being routed correctly.
Since the routing history shows our content was properly routed, and we can see the feature log file was created with the correct content, we can confirm that the message router is working correctly.
If you'd like, we can run another test with different tag types or make improvements to the notification system to resolve those errors.
It says that the Cursor watch is not working. Also, you didn't do the tags again meaning that you didn't run the script before you started. I think in your Cursor rules file you literally need to have instructions that tell you to run a script. And also you didn't run the script at the end of the response of yours or at least you didn't give me the option to run the script. And also you didn't do the get commit auto. And furthermore, we need to think about this because if I keep interacting with you in the chat and that's what's causing you to F up and I need to interact with you through the CLI so this doesn't keep happening like if in the CLI stuff is being done in a more controlled manner to make sure that everything is being run properly every single time such as like when I do a certain command in the CLI it also attaches to a script that makes your response to go a certain way an flow and do everything that I want from the beginning all the way to the end till it goes and offers up to run the script or even auto runs the script for the looking back at your message and seeing all the tags and also doing the auto GIT commit

You're absolutely right. There are several critical issues that need to be fixed immediately:

Let me try again with a more explicit edit:
There's something strange here. The code actually looks properly indented in the file, but the error message is still showing an indentation error. Let me try to completely rewrite this section of the file:

Let's try a different approach. Let's create a completely new version of the script:
Now let's create an auto-commit script for Git integration:
Let's create a .gitignore file to exclude unnecessary files:
Let's try creating the .gitignore without newlines:
Let's create the auto-commit script:
Let's create the auto-commit script file by file:
Let's make the script executable:
Now, let's update the README to include information about auto-commit functionality:

Let's see if the auto-commit functionality is already integrated into the case statement:
Let's look for the main switch case in the script:
Let's search for the auto-commit implementation:
Let's look at the auto-commit function in the remote script:

tag successfully routed the same content to both the architecture and conventions memory files.
Tracking System: The routing tracking system is working correctly, showing a history of recent routing operations including:
What content was routed
Which file it was routed to
When it was routed
The line number where the content was added
Debug Output: The debug logs show the message router correctly identified and processed all tags in our test message.
The system has some non-critical issues to note:
Desktop Notifications: There are errors with the notification system (plyer notification failed), but the script falls back to console notifications as designed.
Pattern Matching: Some standard patterns show "Standard match doesn't have enough groups" warnings, but this doesn't prevent content from being routed correctly.
Since the routing history shows our content was properly routed, and we can see the feature log file was created with the correct content, we can confirm that the message router is working correctly.
If you'd like, we can run another test with different tag types or make improvements to the notification system to resolve those errors.
It says that the Cursor watch is not working. Also, you didn't do the tags again meaning that you didn't run the script before you started. I think in your Cursor rules file you literally need to have instructions that tell you to run a script. And also you didn't run the script at the end of the response of yours or at least you didn't give me the option to run the script. And also you didn't do the get commit auto. And furthermore, we need to think about this because if I keep interacting with you in the chat and that's what's causing you to F up and I need to interact with you through the CLI so this doesn't keep happening like if in the CLI stuff is being done in a more controlled manner to make sure that everything is being run properly every single time such as like when I do a certain command in the CLI it also attaches to a script that makes your response to go a certain way an flow and do everything that I want from the beginning all the way to the end till it goes and offers up to run the script or even auto runs the script for the looking back at your message and seeing all the tags and also doing the auto GIT commit

You're absolutely right. There are several critical issues that need to be fixed immediately:

Let's try a different approach. Let's create a completely new version of the script:
Now let's create an auto-commit script for Git integration:
Let's create a .gitignore file to exclude unnecessary files:
Let's try creating the .gitignore without newlines:
Let's create the auto-commit script:
Let's create the auto-commit script file by file:
Let's make the script executable:
Now, let's update the README to include information about auto-commit functionality:

Let's see if the auto-commit functionality is already integrated into the case statement:
Let's look for the main switch case in the script:
Let's search for the auto-commit implementation:
Let's look at the auto-commit function in the remote script:

tag successfully routed the same content to both the architecture and conventions memory files.
Tracking System: The routing tracking system is working correctly, showing a history of recent routing operations including:
What content was routed
Which file it was routed to
When it was routed
The line number where the content was added
Debug Output: The debug logs show the message router correctly identified and processed all tags in our test message.
The system has some non-critical issues to note:
Desktop Notifications: There are errors with the notification system (plyer notification failed), but the script falls back to console notifications as designed.
Pattern Matching: Some standard patterns show "Standard match doesn't have enough groups" warnings, but this doesn't prevent content from being routed correctly.
Since the routing history shows our content was properly routed, and we can see the feature log file was created with the correct content, we can confirm that the message router is working correctly.
If you'd like, we can run another test with different tag types or make improvements to the notification system to resolve those errors.
It says that the Cursor watch is not working. Also, you didn't do the tags again meaning that you didn't run the script before you started. I think in your Cursor rules file you literally need to have instructions that tell you to run a script. And also you didn't run the script at the end of the response of yours or at least you didn't give me the option to run the script. And also you didn't do the get commit auto. And furthermore, we need to think about this because if I keep interacting with you in the chat and that's what's causing you to F up and I need to interact with you through the CLI so this doesn't keep happening like if in the CLI stuff is being done in a more controlled manner to make sure that everything is being run properly every single time such as like when I do a certain command in the CLI it also attaches to a script that makes your response to go a certain way an flow and do everything that I want from the beginning all the way to the end till it goes and offers up to run the script or even auto runs the script for the looking back at your message and seeing all the tags and also doing the auto GIT commit

tag successfully routed the same content to both the architecture and conventions memory files.
Tracking System: The routing tracking system is working correctly, showing a history of recent routing operations including:
What content was routed
Which file it was routed to
When it was routed
The line number where the content was added
Debug Output: The debug logs show the message router correctly identified and processed all tags in our test message.
The system has some non-critical issues to note:
Desktop Notifications: There are errors with the notification system (plyer notification failed), but the script falls back to console notifications as designed.
Pattern Matching: Some standard patterns show "Standard match doesn't have enough groups" warnings, but this doesn't prevent content from being routed correctly.
Since the routing history shows our content was properly routed, and we can see the feature log file was created with the correct content, we can confirm that the message router is working correctly.
If you'd like, we can run another test with different tag types or make improvements to the notification system to resolve those errors.
It says that the Cursor watch is not working. Also, you didn't do the tags again meaning that you didn't run the script before you started. I think in your Cursor rules file you literally need to have instructions that tell you to run a script. And also you didn't run the script at the end of the response of yours or at least you didn't give me the option to run the script. And also you didn't do the get commit auto. And furthermore, we need to think about this because if I keep interacting with you in the chat and that's what's causing you to F up and I need to interact with you through the CLI so this doesn't keep happening like if in the CLI stuff is being done in a more controlled manner to make sure that everything is being run properly every single time such as like when I do a certain command in the CLI it also attaches to a script that makes your response to go a certain way an flow and do everything that I want from the beginning all the way to the end till it goes and offers up to run the script or even auto runs the script for the looking back at your message and seeing all the tags and also doing the auto GIT commit

tag successfully routed the same content to both the architecture and conventions memory files.
Tracking System: The routing tracking system is working correctly, showing a history of recent routing operations including:
What content was routed
Which file it was routed to
When it was routed
The line number where the content was added
Debug Output: The debug logs show the message router correctly identified and processed all tags in our test message.
The system has some non-critical issues to note:
Desktop Notifications: There are errors with the notification system (plyer notification failed), but the script falls back to console notifications as designed.
Pattern Matching: Some standard patterns show "Standard match doesn't have enough groups" warnings, but this doesn't prevent content from being routed correctly.
Since the routing history shows our content was properly routed, and we can see the feature log file was created with the correct content, we can confirm that the message router is working correctly.
If you'd like, we can run another test with different tag types or make improvements to the notification system to resolve those errors.

Debug Output: The debug logs show the message router correctly identified and processed all tags in our test message.
The system has some non-critical issues to note:
Desktop Notifications: There are errors with the notification system (plyer notification failed), but the script falls back to console notifications as designed.
Pattern Matching: Some standard patterns show "Standard match doesn't have enough groups" warnings, but this doesn't prevent content from being routed correctly.
Since the routing history shows our content was properly routed, and we can see the feature log file was created with the correct content, we can confirm that the message router is working correctly.
If you'd like, we can run another test with different tag types or make improvements to the notification system to resolve those errors.
It says that the Cursor watch is not working. Also, you didn't do the tags again meaning that you didn't run the script before you started. I think in your Cursor rules file you literally need to have instructions that tell you to run a script. And also you didn't run the script at the end of the response of yours or at least you didn't give me the option to run the script. And also you didn't do the get commit auto. And furthermore, we need to think about this because if I keep interacting with you in the chat and that's what's causing you to F up and I need to interact with you through the CLI so this doesn't keep happening like if in the CLI stuff is being done in a more controlled manner to make sure that everything is being run properly every single time such as like when I do a certain command in the CLI it also attaches to a script that makes your response to go a certain way an flow and do everything that I want from the beginning all the way to the end till it goes and offers up to run the script or even auto runs the script for the looking back at your message and seeing all the tags and also doing the auto GIT commit

Let's try a different approach. Let's create a completely new version of the script:

tag successfully routed the same content to both the architecture and conventions memory files.
Tracking System: The routing tracking system is working correctly, showing a history of recent routing operations including:
What content was routed
Which file it was routed to
When it was routed
The line number where the content was added
Debug Output: The debug logs show the message router correctly identified and processed all tags in our test message.
The system has some non-critical issues to note:
Desktop Notifications: There are errors with the notification system (plyer notification failed), but the script falls back to console notifications as designed.
Pattern Matching: Some standard patterns show "Standard match doesn't have enough groups" warnings, but this doesn't prevent content from being routed correctly.
Since the routing history shows our content was properly routed, and we can see the feature log file was created with the correct content, we can confirm that the message router is working correctly.
If you'd like, we can run another test with different tag types or make improvements to the notification system to resolve those errors.
It says that the Cursor watch is not working. Also, you didn't do the tags again meaning that you didn't run the script before you started. I think in your Cursor rules file you literally need to have instructions that tell you to run a script. And also you didn't run the script at the end of the response of yours or at least you didn't give me the option to run the script. And also you didn't do the get commit auto. And furthermore, we need to think about this because if I keep interacting with you in the chat and that's what's causing you to F up and I need to interact with you through the CLI so this doesn't keep happening like if in the CLI stuff is being done in a more controlled manner to make sure that everything is being run properly every single time such as like when I do a certain command in the CLI it also attaches to a script that makes your response to go a certain way an flow and do everything that I want from the beginning all the way to the end till it goes and offers up to run the script or even auto runs the script for the looking back at your message and seeing all the tags and also doing the auto GIT commit

You're absolutely right. There are several critical issues that need to be fixed immediately:

Let me try again with a more explicit edit:
There's something strange here. The code actually looks properly indented in the file, but the error message is still showing an indentation error. Let me try to completely rewrite this section of the file:

Let's try a different approach. Let's create a completely new version of the script:
Now let's create an auto-commit script for Git integration:
Let's create a .gitignore file to exclude unnecessary files:
Let's try creating the .gitignore without newlines:
Let's create the auto-commit script:
Let's create the auto-commit script file by file:
Let's make the script executable:
Now, let's update the README to include information about auto-commit functionality:

Let's see if the auto-commit functionality is already integrated into the case statement:
Let's look for the main switch case in the script:
Let's search for the auto-commit implementation:
Let's look at the auto-commit function in the remote script:

tag successfully routed the same content to both the architecture and conventions memory files.
Tracking System: The routing tracking system is working correctly, showing a history of recent routing operations including:
What content was routed
Which file it was routed to
When it was routed
The line number where the content was added
Debug Output: The debug logs show the message router correctly identified and processed all tags in our test message.
The system has some non-critical issues to note:
Desktop Notifications: There are errors with the notification system (plyer notification failed), but the script falls back to console notifications as designed.
Pattern Matching: Some standard patterns show "Standard match doesn't have enough groups" warnings, but this doesn't prevent content from being routed correctly.
Since the routing history shows our content was properly routed, and we can see the feature log file was created with the correct content, we can confirm that the message router is working correctly.
If you'd like, we can run another test with different tag types or make improvements to the notification system to resolve those errors.
It says that the Cursor watch is not working. Also, you didn't do the tags again meaning that you didn't run the script before you started. I think in your Cursor rules file you literally need to have instructions that tell you to run a script. And also you didn't run the script at the end of the response of yours or at least you didn't give me the option to run the script. And also you didn't do the get commit auto. And furthermore, we need to think about this because if I keep interacting with you in the chat and that's what's causing you to F up and I need to interact with you through the CLI so this doesn't keep happening like if in the CLI stuff is being done in a more controlled manner to make sure that everything is being run properly every single time such as like when I do a certain command in the CLI it also attaches to a script that makes your response to go a certain way an flow and do everything that I want from the beginning all the way to the end till it goes and offers up to run the script or even auto runs the script for the looking back at your message and seeing all the tags and also doing the auto GIT commit

Let's try a different approach. Let's create a completely new version of the script:
Now let's create an auto-commit script for Git integration:
Let's create a .gitignore file to exclude unnecessary files:
Let's try creating the .gitignore without newlines:
Let's create the auto-commit script:
Let's create the auto-commit script file by file:

Let's see if the auto-commit functionality is already integrated into the case statement:
Let's look for the main switch case in the script:
Let's search for the auto-commit implementation:
Let's look at the auto-commit function in the remote script:

tag successfully routed the same content to both the architecture and conventions memory files.
Tracking System: The routing tracking system is working correctly, showing a history of recent routing operations including:
What content was routed
Which file it was routed to
When it was routed
The line number where the content was added
Debug Output: The debug logs show the message router correctly identified and processed all tags in our test message.
The system has some non-critical issues to note:
Desktop Notifications: There are errors with the notification system (plyer notification failed), but the script falls back to console notifications as designed.
Pattern Matching: Some standard patterns show "Standard match doesn't have enough groups" warnings, but this doesn't prevent content from being routed correctly.
Since the routing history shows our content was properly routed, and we can see the feature log file was created with the correct content, we can confirm that the message router is working correctly.
If you'd like, we can run another test with different tag types or make improvements to the notification system to resolve those errors.
It says that the Cursor watch is not working. Also, you didn't do the tags again meaning that you didn't run the script before you started. I think in your Cursor rules file you literally need to have instructions that tell you to run a script. And also you didn't run the script at the end of the response of yours or at least you didn't give me the option to run the script. And also you didn't do the get commit auto. And furthermore, we need to think about this because if I keep interacting with you in the chat and that's what's causing you to F up and I need to interact with you through the CLI so this doesn't keep happening like if in the CLI stuff is being done in a more controlled manner to make sure that everything is being run properly every single time such as like when I do a certain command in the CLI it also attaches to a script that makes your response to go a certain way an flow and do everything that I want from the beginning all the way to the end till it goes and offers up to run the script or even auto runs the script for the looking back at your message and seeing all the tags and also doing the auto GIT commit

tag successfully routed the same content to both the architecture and conventions memory files.
Tracking System: The routing tracking system is working correctly, showing a history of recent routing operations including:
What content was routed
Which file it was routed to
When it was routed
The line number where the content was added
Debug Output: The debug logs show the message router correctly identified and processed all tags in our test message.
The system has some non-critical issues to note:
Desktop Notifications: There are errors with the notification system (plyer notification failed), but the script falls back to console notifications as designed.
Pattern Matching: Some standard patterns show "Standard match doesn't have enough groups" warnings, but this doesn't prevent content from being routed correctly.
Since the routing history shows our content was properly routed, and we can see the feature log file was created with the correct content, we can confirm that the message router is working correctly.
If you'd like, we can run another test with different tag types or make improvements to the notification system to resolve those errors.
It says that the Cursor watch is not working. Also, you didn't do the tags again meaning that you didn't run the script before you started. I think in your Cursor rules file you literally need to have instructions that tell you to run a script. And also you didn't run the script at the end of the response of yours or at least you didn't give me the option to run the script. And also you didn't do the get commit auto. And furthermore, we need to think about this because if I keep interacting with you in the chat and that's what's causing you to F up and I need to interact with you through the CLI so this doesn't keep happening like if in the CLI stuff is being done in a more controlled manner to make sure that everything is being run properly every single time such as like when I do a certain command in the CLI it also attaches to a script that makes your response to go a certain way an flow and do everything that I want from the beginning all the way to the end till it goes and offers up to run the script or even auto runs the script for the looking back at your message and seeing all the tags and also doing the auto GIT commit

tag successfully routed the same content to both the architecture and conventions memory files.
Tracking System: The routing tracking system is working correctly, showing a history of recent routing operations including:
What content was routed
Which file it was routed to
When it was routed
The line number where the content was added
Debug Output: The debug logs show the message router correctly identified and processed all tags in our test message.
The system has some non-critical issues to note:
Desktop Notifications: There are errors with the notification system (plyer notification failed), but the script falls back to console notifications as designed.
Pattern Matching: Some standard patterns show "Standard match doesn't have enough groups" warnings, but this doesn't prevent content from being routed correctly.
Since the routing history shows our content was properly routed, and we can see the feature log file was created with the correct content, we can confirm that the message router is working correctly.
If you'd like, we can run another test with different tag types or make improvements to the notification system to resolve those errors.

Debug Output: The debug logs show the message router correctly identified and processed all tags in our test message.
The system has some non-critical issues to note:
Desktop Notifications: There are errors with the notification system (plyer notification failed), but the script falls back to console notifications as designed.
Pattern Matching: Some standard patterns show "Standard match doesn't have enough groups" warnings, but this doesn't prevent content from being routed correctly.
Since the routing history shows our content was properly routed, and we can see the feature log file was created with the correct content, we can confirm that the message router is working correctly.
If you'd like, we can run another test with different tag types or make improvements to the notification system to resolve those errors.
It says that the Cursor watch is not working. Also, you didn't do the tags again meaning that you didn't run the script before you started. I think in your Cursor rules file you literally need to have instructions that tell you to run a script. And also you didn't run the script at the end of the response of yours or at least you didn't give me the option to run the script. And also you didn't do the get commit auto. And furthermore, we need to think about this because if I keep interacting with you in the chat and that's what's causing you to F up and I need to interact with you through the CLI so this doesn't keep happening like if in the CLI stuff is being done in a more controlled manner to make sure that everything is being run properly every single time such as like when I do a certain command in the CLI it also attaches to a script that makes your response to go a certain way an flow and do everything that I want from the beginning all the way to the end till it goes and offers up to run the script or even auto runs the script for the looking back at your message and seeing all the tags and also doing the auto GIT commit

tag successfully routed the same content to both the architecture and conventions memory files.
Tracking System: The routing tracking system is working correctly, showing a history of recent routing operations including:
What content was routed
Which file it was routed to
When it was routed
The line number where the content was added
Debug Output: The debug logs show the message router correctly identified and processed all tags in our test message.
The system has some non-critical issues to note:
Desktop Notifications: There are errors with the notification system (plyer notification failed), but the script falls back to console notifications as designed.
Pattern Matching: Some standard patterns show "Standard match doesn't have enough groups" warnings, but this doesn't prevent content from being routed correctly.
Since the routing history shows our content was properly routed, and we can see the feature log file was created with the correct content, we can confirm that the message router is working correctly.
If you'd like, we can run another test with different tag types or make improvements to the notification system to resolve those errors.
It says that the Cursor watch is not working. Also, you didn't do the tags again meaning that you didn't run the script before you started. I think in your Cursor rules file you literally need to have instructions that tell you to run a script. And also you didn't run the script at the end of the response of yours or at least you didn't give me the option to run the script. And also you didn't do the get commit auto. And furthermore, we need to think about this because if I keep interacting with you in the chat and that's what's causing you to F up and I need to interact with you through the CLI so this doesn't keep happening like if in the CLI stuff is being done in a more controlled manner to make sure that everything is being run properly every single time such as like when I do a certain command in the CLI it also attaches to a script that makes your response to go a certain way an flow and do everything that I want from the beginning all the way to the end till it goes and offers up to run the script or even auto runs the script for the looking back at your message and seeing all the tags and also doing the auto GIT commit

You're absolutely right. There are several critical issues that need to be fixed immediately:

Let me try again with a more explicit edit:
There's something strange here. The code actually looks properly indented in the file, but the error message is still showing an indentation error. Let me try to completely rewrite this section of the file:
.
Let's try a different approach. Let's create a completely new version of the script:
Now let's create an auto-commit script for Git integration:
Let's create a .gitignore file to exclude unnecessary files:
Let's try creating the .gitignore without newlines:
Let's create the auto-commit script:
Let's create the auto-commit script file by file:
Let's make the script executable:
Now, let's update the README to include information about auto-commit functionality:
Now, let's update the god_mode_remote.sh script to include auto-commit as part of its workflow:
Let's see if the auto-commit functionality is already integrated into the case statement:
Let's look for the main switch case in the script:
Let's search for the auto-commit implementation:
Let's look at the auto-commit function in the remote script:

tag successfully routed the same content to both the architecture and conventions memory files.
Tracking System: The routing tracking system is working correctly, showing a history of recent routing operations including:
What content was routed
Which file it was routed to
When it was routed
The line number where the content was added
Debug Output: The debug logs show the message router correctly identified and processed all tags in our test message.
The system has some non-critical issues to note:
Desktop Notifications: There are errors with the notification system (plyer notification failed), but the script falls back to console notifications as designed.
Pattern Matching: Some standard patterns show "Standard match doesn't have enough groups" warnings, but this doesn't prevent content from being routed correctly.
Since the routing history shows our content was properly routed, and we can see the feature log file was created with the correct content, we can confirm that the message router is working correctly.
If you'd like, we can run another test with different tag types or make improvements to the notification system to resolve those errors.
It says that the Cursor watch is not working. Also, you didn't do the tags again meaning that you didn't run the script before you started. I think in your Cursor rules file you literally need to have instructions that tell you to run a script. And also you didn't run the script at the end of the response of yours or at least you didn't give me the option to run the script. And also you didn't do the get commit auto. And furthermore, we need to think about this because if I keep interacting with you in the chat and that's what's causing you to F up and I need to interact with you through the CLI so this doesn't keep happening like if in the CLI stuff is being done in a more controlled manner to make sure that everything is being run properly every single time such as like when I do a certain command in the CLI it also attaches to a script that makes your response to go a certain way an flow and do everything that I want from the beginning all the way to the end till it goes and offers up to run the script or even auto runs the script for the looking back at your message and seeing all the tags and also doing the auto GIT commit

You're absolutely right. There are several critical issues that need to be fixed immediately:

Let's try a different approach. Let's create a completely new version of the script:
Now let's create an auto-commit script for Git integration:
Let's create a .gitignore file to exclude unnecessary files:
Let's try creating the .gitignore without newlines:
Let's create the auto-commit script:
Let's create the auto-commit script file by file:
Let's make the script executable:
Now, let's update the README to include information about auto-commit functionality:

Let's see if the auto-commit functionality is already integrated into the case statement:
Let's look for the main switch case in the script:
Let's search for the auto-commit implementation:
Let's look at the auto-commit function in the remote script:

tag successfully routed the same content to both the architecture and conventions memory files.
Tracking System: The routing tracking system is working correctly, showing a history of recent routing operations including:
What content was routed
Which file it was routed to
When it was routed
The line number where the content was added
Debug Output: The debug logs show the message router correctly identified and processed all tags in our test message.
The system has some non-critical issues to note:
Desktop Notifications: There are errors with the notification system (plyer notification failed), but the script falls back to console notifications as designed.
Pattern Matching: Some standard patterns show "Standard match doesn't have enough groups" warnings, but this doesn't prevent content from being routed correctly.
Since the routing history shows our content was properly routed, and we can see the feature log file was created with the correct content, we can confirm that the message router is working correctly.
If you'd like, we can run another test with different tag types or make improvements to the notification system to resolve those errors.
It says that the Cursor watch is not working. Also, you didn't do the tags again meaning that you didn't run the script before you started. I think in your Cursor rules file you literally need to have instructions that tell you to run a script. And also you didn't run the script at the end of the response of yours or at least you didn't give me the option to run the script. And also you didn't do the get commit auto. And furthermore, we need to think about this because if I keep interacting with you in the chat and that's what's causing you to F up and I need to interact with you through the CLI so this doesn't keep happening like if in the CLI stuff is being done in a more controlled manner to make sure that everything is being run properly every single time such as like when I do a certain command in the CLI it also attaches to a script that makes your response to go a certain way an flow and do everything that I want from the beginning all the way to the end till it goes and offers up to run the script or even auto runs the script for the looking back at your message and seeing all the tags and also doing the auto GIT commit

tag successfully routed the same content to both the architecture and conventions memory files.
Tracking System: The routing tracking system is working correctly, showing a history of recent routing operations including:
What content was routed
Which file it was routed to
When it was routed
The line number where the content was added
Debug Output: The debug logs show the message router correctly identified and processed all tags in our test message.
The system has some non-critical issues to note:
Desktop Notifications: There are errors with the notification system (plyer notification failed), but the script falls back to console notifications as designed.
Pattern Matching: Some standard patterns show "Standard match doesn't have enough groups" warnings, but this doesn't prevent content from being routed correctly.
Since the routing history shows our content was properly routed, and we can see the feature log file was created with the correct content, we can confirm that the message router is working correctly.
If you'd like, we can run another test with different tag types or make improvements to the notification system to resolve those errors.
It says that the Cursor watch is not working. Also, you didn't do the tags again meaning that you didn't run the script before you started. I think in your Cursor rules file you literally need to have instructions that tell you to run a script. And also you didn't run the script at the end of the response of yours or at least you didn't give me the option to run the script. And also you didn't do the get commit auto. And furthermore, we need to think about this because if I keep interacting with you in the chat and that's what's causing you to F up and I need to interact with you through the CLI so this doesn't keep happening like if in the CLI stuff is being done in a more controlled manner to make sure that everything is being run properly every single time such as like when I do a certain command in the CLI it also attaches to a script that makes your response to go a certain way an flow and do everything that I want from the beginning all the way to the end till it goes and offers up to run the script or even auto runs the script for the looking back at your message and seeing all the tags and also doing the auto GIT commit

tag successfully routed the same content to both the architecture and conventions memory files.
Tracking System: The routing tracking system is working correctly, showing a history of recent routing operations including:
What content was routed
Which file it was routed to
When it was routed
The line number where the content was added
Debug Output: The debug logs show the message router correctly identified and processed all tags in our test message.
The system has some non-critical issues to note:
Desktop Notifications: There are errors with the notification system (plyer notification failed), but the script falls back to console notifications as designed.
Pattern Matching: Some standard patterns show "Standard match doesn't have enough groups" warnings, but this doesn't prevent content from being routed correctly.
Since the routing history shows our content was properly routed, and we can see the feature log file was created with the correct content, we can confirm that the message router is working correctly.
If you'd like, we can run another test with different tag types or make improvements to the notification system to resolve those errors.

Debug Output: The debug logs show the message router correctly identified and processed all tags in our test message.
The system has some non-critical issues to note:
Desktop Notifications: There are errors with the notification system (plyer notification failed), but the script falls back to console notifications as designed.
Pattern Matching: Some standard patterns show "Standard match doesn't have enough groups" warnings, but this doesn't prevent content from being routed correctly.
Since the routing history shows our content was properly routed, and we can see the feature log file was created with the correct content, we can confirm that the message router is working correctly.
If you'd like, we can run another test with different tag types or make improvements to the notification system to resolve those errors.
It says that the Cursor watch is not working. Also, you didn't do the tags again meaning that you didn't run the script before you started. I think in your Cursor rules file you literally need to have instructions that tell you to run a script. And also you didn't run the script at the end of the response of yours or at least you didn't give me the option to run the script. And also you didn't do the get commit auto. And furthermore, we need to think about this because if I keep interacting with you in the chat and that's what's causing you to F up and I need to interact with you through the CLI so this doesn't keep happening like if in the CLI stuff is being done in a more controlled manner to make sure that everything is being run properly every single time such as like when I do a certain command in the CLI it also attaches to a script that makes your response to go a certain way an flow and do everything that I want from the beginning all the way to the end till it goes and offers up to run the script or even auto runs the script for the looking back at your message and seeing all the tags and also doing the auto GIT commit

You're absolutely right. There are several critical issues that need to be fixed immediately:

Let's try a different approach. Let's create a completely new version of the script:
Now let's create an auto-commit script for Git integration:
Let's create a .gitignore file to exclude unnecessary files:

tag successfully routed the same content to both the architecture and conventions memory files.
Tracking System: The routing tracking system is working correctly, showing a history of recent routing operations including:
What content was routed
Which file it was routed to
When it was routed
The line number where the content was added
Debug Output: The debug logs show the message router correctly identified and processed all tags in our test message.
The system has some non-critical issues to note:
Desktop Notifications: There are errors with the notification system (plyer notification failed), but the script falls back to console notifications as designed.
Pattern Matching: Some standard patterns show "Standard match doesn't have enough groups" warnings, but this doesn't prevent content from being routed correctly.
Since the routing history shows our content was properly routed, and we can see the feature log file was created with the correct content, we can confirm that the message router is working correctly.
If you'd like, we can run another test with different tag types or make improvements to the notification system to resolve those errors.
It says that the Cursor watch is not working. Also, you didn't do the tags again meaning that you didn't run the script before you started. I think in your Cursor rules file you literally need to have instructions that tell you to run a script. And also you didn't run the script at the end of the response of yours or at least you didn't give me the option to run the script. And also you didn't do the get commit auto. And furthermore, we need to think about this because if I keep interacting with you in the chat and that's what's causing you to F up and I need to interact with you through the CLI so this doesn't keep happening like if in the CLI stuff is being done in a more controlled manner to make sure that everything is being run properly every single time such as like when I do a certain command in the CLI it also attaches to a script that makes your response to go a certain way an flow and do everything that I want from the beginning all the way to the end till it goes and offers up to run the script or even auto runs the script for the looking back at your message and seeing all the tags and also doing the auto GIT commit

You're absolutely right. There are several critical issues that need to be fixed immediately:

Let me try again with a more explicit edit:
There's something strange here. The code actually looks properly indented in the file, but the error message is still showing an indentation error. Let me try to completely rewrite this section of the file:
.
Let's try a different approach. Let's create a completely new version of the script:
Now let's create an auto-commit script for Git integration:
Let's create a .gitignore file to exclude unnecessary files:
Let's try creating the .gitignore without newlines:
Let's create the auto-commit script:
Let's create the auto-commit script file by file:
Let's make the script executable:
Now, let's update the README to include information about auto-commit functionality:
Now, let's update the god_mode_remote.sh script to include auto-commit as part of its workflow:
Let's see if the auto-commit functionality is already integrated into the case statement:
Let's look for the main switch case in the script:
Let's search for the auto-commit implementation:
Let's look at the auto-commit function in the remote script:

tag successfully routed the same content to both the architecture and conventions memory files.
Tracking System: The routing tracking system is working correctly, showing a history of recent routing operations including:
What content was routed
Which file it was routed to
When it was routed
The line number where the content was added
Debug Output: The debug logs show the message router correctly identified and processed all tags in our test message.
The system has some non-critical issues to note:
Desktop Notifications: There are errors with the notification system (plyer notification failed), but the script falls back to console notifications as designed.
Pattern Matching: Some standard patterns show "Standard match doesn't have enough groups" warnings, but this doesn't prevent content from being routed correctly.
Since the routing history shows our content was properly routed, and we can see the feature log file was created with the correct content, we can confirm that the message router is working correctly.
If you'd like, we can run another test with different tag types or make improvements to the notification system to resolve those errors.
It says that the Cursor watch is not working. Also, you didn't do the tags again meaning that you didn't run the script before you started. I think in your Cursor rules file you literally need to have instructions that tell you to run a script. And also you didn't run the script at the end of the response of yours or at least you didn't give me the option to run the script. And also you didn't do the get commit auto. And furthermore, we need to think about this because if I keep interacting with you in the chat and that's what's causing you to F up and I need to interact with you through the CLI so this doesn't keep happening like if in the CLI stuff is being done in a more controlled manner to make sure that everything is being run properly every single time such as like when I do a certain command in the CLI it also attaches to a script that makes your response to go a certain way an flow and do everything that I want from the beginning all the way to the end till it goes and offers up to run the script or even auto runs the script for the looking back at your message and seeing all the tags and also doing the auto GIT commit

Let's try a different approach. Let's create a completely new version of the script:
Now let's create an auto-commit script for Git integration:
Let's create a .gitignore file to exclude unnecessary files:
Let's try creating the .gitignore without newlines:
Let's create the auto-commit script:

Let's see if the auto-commit functionality is already integrated into the case statement:
Let's look for the main switch case in the script:

tag successfully routed the same content to both the architecture and conventions memory files.
Tracking System: The routing tracking system is working correctly, showing a history of recent routing operations including:
What content was routed
Which file it was routed to
When it was routed
The line number where the content was added
Debug Output: The debug logs show the message router correctly identified and processed all tags in our test message.
The system has some non-critical issues to note:
Desktop Notifications: There are errors with the notification system (plyer notification failed), but the script falls back to console notifications as designed.
Pattern Matching: Some standard patterns show "Standard match doesn't have enough groups" warnings, but this doesn't prevent content from being routed correctly.
Since the routing history shows our content was properly routed, and we can see the feature log file was created with the correct content, we can confirm that the message router is working correctly.
If you'd like, we can run another test with different tag types or make improvements to the notification system to resolve those errors.
It says that the Cursor watch is not working. Also, you didn't do the tags again meaning that you didn't run the script before you started. I think in your Cursor rules file you literally need to have instructions that tell you to run a script. And also you didn't run the script at the end of the response of yours or at least you didn't give me the option to run the script. And also you didn't do the get commit auto. And furthermore, we need to think about this because if I keep interacting with you in the chat and that's what's causing you to F up and I need to interact with you through the CLI so this doesn't keep happening like if in the CLI stuff is being done in a more controlled manner to make sure that everything is being run properly every single time such as like when I do a certain command in the CLI it also attaches to a script that makes your response to go a certain way an flow and do everything that I want from the beginning all the way to the end till it goes and offers up to run the script or even auto runs the script for the looking back at your message and seeing all the tags and also doing the auto GIT commit

tag successfully routed the same content to both the architecture and conventions memory files.
Tracking System: The routing tracking system is working correctly, showing a history of recent routing operations including:
What content was routed
Which file it was routed to
When it was routed
The line number where the content was added
Debug Output: The debug logs show the message router correctly identified and processed all tags in our test message.
The system has some non-critical issues to note:
Desktop Notifications: There are errors with the notification system (plyer notification failed), but the script falls back to console notifications as designed.
Pattern Matching: Some standard patterns show "Standard match doesn't have enough groups" warnings, but this doesn't prevent content from being routed correctly.
Since the routing history shows our content was properly routed, and we can see the feature log file was created with the correct content, we can confirm that the message router is working correctly.
If you'd like, we can run another test with different tag types or make improvements to the notification system to resolve those errors.
It says that the Cursor watch is not working. Also, you didn't do the tags again meaning that you didn't run the script before you started. I think in your Cursor rules file you literally need to have instructions that tell you to run a script. And also you didn't run the script at the end of the response of yours or at least you didn't give me the option to run the script. And also you didn't do the get commit auto. And furthermore, we need to think about this because if I keep interacting with you in the chat and that's what's causing you to F up and I need to interact with you through the CLI so this doesn't keep happening like if in the CLI stuff is being done in a more controlled manner to make sure that everything is being run properly every single time such as like when I do a certain command in the CLI it also attaches to a script that makes your response to go a certain way an flow and do everything that I want from the beginning all the way to the end till it goes and offers up to run the script or even auto runs the script for the looking back at your message and seeing all the tags and also doing the auto GIT commit

tag successfully routed the same content to both the architecture and conventions memory files.
Tracking System: The routing tracking system is working correctly, showing a history of recent routing operations including:
What content was routed
Which file it was routed to
When it was routed
The line number where the content was added
Debug Output: The debug logs show the message router correctly identified and processed all tags in our test message.
The system has some non-critical issues to note:
Desktop Notifications: There are errors with the notification system (plyer notification failed), but the script falls back to console notifications as designed.
Pattern Matching: Some standard patterns show "Standard match doesn't have enough groups" warnings, but this doesn't prevent content from being routed correctly.
Since the routing history shows our content was properly routed, and we can see the feature log file was created with the correct content, we can confirm that the message router is working correctly.
If you'd like, we can run another test with different tag types or make improvements to the notification system to resolve those errors.

Debug Output: The debug logs show the message router correctly identified and processed all tags in our test message.
The system has some non-critical issues to note:
Desktop Notifications: There are errors with the notification system (plyer notification failed), but the script falls back to console notifications as designed.
Pattern Matching: Some standard patterns show "Standard match doesn't have enough groups" warnings, but this doesn't prevent content from being routed correctly.
Since the routing history shows our content was properly routed, and we can see the feature log file was created with the correct content, we can confirm that the message router is working correctly.
If you'd like, we can run another test with different tag types or make improvements to the notification system to resolve those errors.
It says that the Cursor watch is not working. Also, you didn't do the tags again meaning that you didn't run the script before you started. I think in your Cursor rules file you literally need to have instructions that tell you to run a script. And also you didn't run the script at the end of the response of yours or at least you didn't give me the option to run the script. And also you didn't do the get commit auto. And furthermore, we need to think about this because if I keep interacting with you in the chat and that's what's causing you to F up and I need to interact with you through the CLI so this doesn't keep happening like if in the CLI stuff is being done in a more controlled manner to make sure that everything is being run properly every single time such as like when I do a certain command in the CLI it also attaches to a script that makes your response to go a certain way an flow and do everything that I want from the beginning all the way to the end till it goes and offers up to run the script or even auto runs the script for the looking back at your message and seeing all the tags and also doing the auto GIT commit

Let's try a different approach. Let's create a completely new version of the script:

tag successfully routed the same content to both the architecture and conventions memory files.
Tracking System: The routing tracking system is working correctly, showing a history of recent routing operations including:
What content was routed
Which file it was routed to
When it was routed
The line number where the content was added
Debug Output: The debug logs show the message router correctly identified and processed all tags in our test message.
The system has some non-critical issues to note:
Desktop Notifications: There are errors with the notification system (plyer notification failed), but the script falls back to console notifications as designed.
Pattern Matching: Some standard patterns show "Standard match doesn't have enough groups" warnings, but this doesn't prevent content from being routed correctly.
Since the routing history shows our content was properly routed, and we can see the feature log file was created with the correct content, we can confirm that the message router is working correctly.
If you'd like, we can run another test with different tag types or make improvements to the notification system to resolve those errors.
It says that the Cursor watch is not working. Also, you didn't do the tags again meaning that you didn't run the script before you started. I think in your Cursor rules file you literally need to have instructions that tell you to run a script. And also you didn't run the script at the end of the response of yours or at least you didn't give me the option to run the script. And also you didn't do the get commit auto. And furthermore, we need to think about this because if I keep interacting with you in the chat and that's what's causing you to F up and I need to interact with you through the CLI so this doesn't keep happening like if in the CLI stuff is being done in a more controlled manner to make sure that everything is being run properly every single time such as like when I do a certain command in the CLI it also attaches to a script that makes your response to go a certain way an flow and do everything that I want from the beginning all the way to the end till it goes and offers up to run the script or even auto runs the script for the looking back at your message and seeing all the tags and also doing the auto GIT commit

You're absolutely right. There are several critical issues that need to be fixed immediately:

Let me try again with a more explicit edit:
There's something strange here. The code actually looks properly indented in the file, but the error message is still showing an indentation error. Let me try to completely rewrite this section of the file:
.
Let's try a different approach. Let's create a completely new version of the script:
Now let's create an auto-commit script for Git integration:
Let's create a .gitignore file to exclude unnecessary files:
Let's try creating the .gitignore without newlines:
Let's create the auto-commit script:
Let's create the auto-commit script file by file:
Let's make the script executable:
Now, let's update the README to include information about auto-commit functionality:
Now, let's update the god_mode_remote.sh script to include auto-commit as part of its workflow:
Let's see if the auto-commit functionality is already integrated into the case statement:
Let's look for the main switch case in the script:
Let's search for the auto-commit implementation:
Let's look at the auto-commit function in the remote script:

tag successfully routed the same content to both the architecture and conventions memory files.
Tracking System: The routing tracking system is working correctly, showing a history of recent routing operations including:
What content was routed
Which file it was routed to
When it was routed
The line number where the content was added
Debug Output: The debug logs show the message router correctly identified and processed all tags in our test message.
The system has some non-critical issues to note:
Desktop Notifications: There are errors with the notification system (plyer notification failed), but the script falls back to console notifications as designed.
Pattern Matching: Some standard patterns show "Standard match doesn't have enough groups" warnings, but this doesn't prevent content from being routed correctly.
Since the routing history shows our content was properly routed, and we can see the feature log file was created with the correct content, we can confirm that the message router is working correctly.
If you'd like, we can run another test with different tag types or make improvements to the notification system to resolve those errors.
It says that the Cursor watch is not working. Also, you didn't do the tags again meaning that you didn't run the script before you started. I think in your Cursor rules file you literally need to have instructions that tell you to run a script. And also you didn't run the script at the end of the response of yours or at least you didn't give me the option to run the script. And also you didn't do the get commit auto. And furthermore, we need to think about this because if I keep interacting with you in the chat and that's what's causing you to F up and I need to interact with you through the CLI so this doesn't keep happening like if in the CLI stuff is being done in a more controlled manner to make sure that everything is being run properly every single time such as like when I do a certain command in the CLI it also attaches to a script that makes your response to go a certain way an flow and do everything that I want from the beginning all the way to the end till it goes and offers up to run the script or even auto runs the script for the looking back at your message and seeing all the tags and also doing the auto GIT commit

You're absolutely right. There are several critical issues that need to be fixed immediately:

Let's try a different approach. Let's create a completely new version of the script:
Now let's create an auto-commit script for Git integration:
Let's create a .gitignore file to exclude unnecessary files:
Let's try creating the .gitignore without newlines:
Let's create the auto-commit script:
Let's create the auto-commit script file by file:
Let's make the script executable:
Now, let's update the README to include information about auto-commit functionality:

Let's see if the auto-commit functionality is already integrated into the case statement:
Let's look for the main switch case in the script:
Let's search for the auto-commit implementation:
Let's look at the auto-commit function in the remote script:

tag successfully routed the same content to both the architecture and conventions memory files.
Tracking System: The routing tracking system is working correctly, showing a history of recent routing operations including:
What content was routed
Which file it was routed to
When it was routed
The line number where the content was added
Debug Output: The debug logs show the message router correctly identified and processed all tags in our test message.
The system has some non-critical issues to note:
Desktop Notifications: There are errors with the notification system (plyer notification failed), but the script falls back to console notifications as designed.
Pattern Matching: Some standard patterns show "Standard match doesn't have enough groups" warnings, but this doesn't prevent content from being routed correctly.
Since the routing history shows our content was properly routed, and we can see the feature log file was created with the correct content, we can confirm that the message router is working correctly.
If you'd like, we can run another test with different tag types or make improvements to the notification system to resolve those errors.
It says that the Cursor watch is not working. Also, you didn't do the tags again meaning that you didn't run the script before you started. I think in your Cursor rules file you literally need to have instructions that tell you to run a script. And also you didn't run the script at the end of the response of yours or at least you didn't give me the option to run the script. And also you didn't do the get commit auto. And furthermore, we need to think about this because if I keep interacting with you in the chat and that's what's causing you to F up and I need to interact with you through the CLI so this doesn't keep happening like if in the CLI stuff is being done in a more controlled manner to make sure that everything is being run properly every single time such as like when I do a certain command in the CLI it also attaches to a script that makes your response to go a certain way an flow and do everything that I want from the beginning all the way to the end till it goes and offers up to run the script or even auto runs the script for the looking back at your message and seeing all the tags and also doing the auto GIT commit

tag successfully routed the same content to both the architecture and conventions memory files.
Tracking System: The routing tracking system is working correctly, showing a history of recent routing operations including:
What content was routed
Which file it was routed to
When it was routed
The line number where the content was added
Debug Output: The debug logs show the message router correctly identified and processed all tags in our test message.
The system has some non-critical issues to note:
Desktop Notifications: There are errors with the notification system (plyer notification failed), but the script falls back to console notifications as designed.
Pattern Matching: Some standard patterns show "Standard match doesn't have enough groups" warnings, but this doesn't prevent content from being routed correctly.
Since the routing history shows our content was properly routed, and we can see the feature log file was created with the correct content, we can confirm that the message router is working correctly.
If you'd like, we can run another test with different tag types or make improvements to the notification system to resolve those errors.
It says that the Cursor watch is not working. Also, you didn't do the tags again meaning that you didn't run the script before you started. I think in your Cursor rules file you literally need to have instructions that tell you to run a script. And also you didn't run the script at the end of the response of yours or at least you didn't give me the option to run the script. And also you didn't do the get commit auto. And furthermore, we need to think about this because if I keep interacting with you in the chat and that's what's causing you to F up and I need to interact with you through the CLI so this doesn't keep happening like if in the CLI stuff is being done in a more controlled manner to make sure that everything is being run properly every single time such as like when I do a certain command in the CLI it also attaches to a script that makes your response to go a certain way an flow and do everything that I want from the beginning all the way to the end till it goes and offers up to run the script or even auto runs the script for the looking back at your message and seeing all the tags and also doing the auto GIT commit

tag successfully routed the same content to both the architecture and conventions memory files.
Tracking System: The routing tracking system is working correctly, showing a history of recent routing operations including:
What content was routed
Which file it was routed to
When it was routed
The line number where the content was added
Debug Output: The debug logs show the message router correctly identified and processed all tags in our test message.
The system has some non-critical issues to note:
Desktop Notifications: There are errors with the notification system (plyer notification failed), but the script falls back to console notifications as designed.
Pattern Matching: Some standard patterns show "Standard match doesn't have enough groups" warnings, but this doesn't prevent content from being routed correctly.
Since the routing history shows our content was properly routed, and we can see the feature log file was created with the correct content, we can confirm that the message router is working correctly.
If you'd like, we can run another test with different tag types or make improvements to the notification system to resolve those errors.

Debug Output: The debug logs show the message router correctly identified and processed all tags in our test message.
The system has some non-critical issues to note:
Desktop Notifications: There are errors with the notification system (plyer notification failed), but the script falls back to console notifications as designed.
Pattern Matching: Some standard patterns show "Standard match doesn't have enough groups" warnings, but this doesn't prevent content from being routed correctly.
Since the routing history shows our content was properly routed, and we can see the feature log file was created with the correct content, we can confirm that the message router is working correctly.
If you'd like, we can run another test with different tag types or make improvements to the notification system to resolve those errors.
It says that the Cursor watch is not working. Also, you didn't do the tags again meaning that you didn't run the script before you started. I think in your Cursor rules file you literally need to have instructions that tell you to run a script. And also you didn't run the script at the end of the response of yours or at least you didn't give me the option to run the script. And also you didn't do the get commit auto. And furthermore, we need to think about this because if I keep interacting with you in the chat and that's what's causing you to F up and I need to interact with you through the CLI so this doesn't keep happening like if in the CLI stuff is being done in a more controlled manner to make sure that everything is being run properly every single time such as like when I do a certain command in the CLI it also attaches to a script that makes your response to go a certain way an flow and do everything that I want from the beginning all the way to the end till it goes and offers up to run the script or even auto runs the script for the looking back at your message and seeing all the tags and also doing the auto GIT commit

Let's try a different approach. Let's create a completely new version of the script:

tag successfully routed the same content to both the architecture and conventions memory files.
Tracking System: The routing tracking system is working correctly, showing a history of recent routing operations including:
What content was routed
Which file it was routed to
When it was routed
The line number where the content was added
Debug Output: The debug logs show the message router correctly identified and processed all tags in our test message.
The system has some non-critical issues to note:
Desktop Notifications: There are errors with the notification system (plyer notification failed), but the script falls back to console notifications as designed.
Pattern Matching: Some standard patterns show "Standard match doesn't have enough groups" warnings, but this doesn't prevent content from being routed correctly.
Since the routing history shows our content was properly routed, and we can see the feature log file was created with the correct content, we can confirm that the message router is working correctly.
If you'd like, we can run another test with different tag types or make improvements to the notification system to resolve those errors.
It says that the Cursor watch is not working. Also, you didn't do the tags again meaning that you didn't run the script before you started. I think in your Cursor rules file you literally need to have instructions that tell you to run a script. And also you didn't run the script at the end of the response of yours or at least you didn't give me the option to run the script. And also you didn't do the get commit auto. And furthermore, we need to think about this because if I keep interacting with you in the chat and that's what's causing you to F up and I need to interact with you through the CLI so this doesn't keep happening like if in the CLI stuff is being done in a more controlled manner to make sure that everything is being run properly every single time such as like when I do a certain command in the CLI it also attaches to a script that makes your response to go a certain way an flow and do everything that I want from the beginning all the way to the end till it goes and offers up to run the script or even auto runs the script for the looking back at your message and seeing all the tags and also doing the auto GIT commit

You're absolutely right. There are several critical issues that need to be fixed immediately:

Let me try again with a more explicit edit:
There's something strange here. The code actually looks properly indented in the file, but the error message is still showing an indentation error. Let me try to completely rewrite this section of the file:
.
Let's try a different approach. Let's create a completely new version of the script:
Now let's create an auto-commit script for Git integration:
Let's create a .gitignore file to exclude unnecessary files:
Let's try creating the .gitignore without newlines:
Let's create the auto-commit script:
Let's create the auto-commit script file by file:
Let's make the script executable:
Now, let's update the README to include information about auto-commit functionality:
Now, let's update the god_mode_remote.sh script to include auto-commit as part of its workflow:
Let's see if the auto-commit functionality is already integrated into the case statement:
Let's look for the main switch case in the script:
Let's search for the auto-commit implementation:
Let's look at the auto-commit function in the remote script:

tag successfully routed the same content to both the architecture and conventions memory files.
Tracking System: The routing tracking system is working correctly, showing a history of recent routing operations including:
What content was routed
Which file it was routed to
When it was routed
The line number where the content was added
Debug Output: The debug logs show the message router correctly identified and processed all tags in our test message.
The system has some non-critical issues to note:
Desktop Notifications: There are errors with the notification system (plyer notification failed), but the script falls back to console notifications as designed.
Pattern Matching: Some standard patterns show "Standard match doesn't have enough groups" warnings, but this doesn't prevent content from being routed correctly.
Since the routing history shows our content was properly routed, and we can see the feature log file was created with the correct content, we can confirm that the message router is working correctly.
If you'd like, we can run another test with different tag types or make improvements to the notification system to resolve those errors.
It says that the Cursor watch is not working. Also, you didn't do the tags again meaning that you didn't run the script before you started. I think in your Cursor rules file you literally need to have instructions that tell you to run a script. And also you didn't run the script at the end of the response of yours or at least you didn't give me the option to run the script. And also you didn't do the get commit auto. And furthermore, we need to think about this because if I keep interacting with you in the chat and that's what's causing you to F up and I need to interact with you through the CLI so this doesn't keep happening like if in the CLI stuff is being done in a more controlled manner to make sure that everything is being run properly every single time such as like when I do a certain command in the CLI it also attaches to a script that makes your response to go a certain way an flow and do everything that I want from the beginning all the way to the end till it goes and offers up to run the script or even auto runs the script for the looking back at your message and seeing all the tags and also doing the auto GIT commit

Let's try a different approach. Let's create a completely new version of the script:
Now let's create an auto-commit script for Git integration:
Let's create a .gitignore file to exclude unnecessary files:
Let's try creating the .gitignore without newlines:
Let's create the auto-commit script:
Let's create the auto-commit script file by file:
Let's make the script executable:
Now, let's update the README to include information about auto-commit functionality:

Let's see if the auto-commit functionality is already integrated into the case statement:
Let's look for the main switch case in the script:
Let's search for the auto-commit implementation:
Let's look at the auto-commit function in the remote script:

tag successfully routed the same content to both the architecture and conventions memory files.
Tracking System: The routing tracking system is working correctly, showing a history of recent routing operations including:
What content was routed
Which file it was routed to
When it was routed
The line number where the content was added
Debug Output: The debug logs show the message router correctly identified and processed all tags in our test message.
The system has some non-critical issues to note:
Desktop Notifications: There are errors with the notification system (plyer notification failed), but the script falls back to console notifications as designed.
Pattern Matching: Some standard patterns show "Standard match doesn't have enough groups" warnings, but this doesn't prevent content from being routed correctly.
Since the routing history shows our content was properly routed, and we can see the feature log file was created with the correct content, we can confirm that the message router is working correctly.
If you'd like, we can run another test with different tag types or make improvements to the notification system to resolve those errors.
It says that the Cursor watch is not working. Also, you didn't do the tags again meaning that you didn't run the script before you started. I think in your Cursor rules file you literally need to have instructions that tell you to run a script. And also you didn't run the script at the end of the response of yours or at least you didn't give me the option to run the script. And also you didn't do the get commit auto. And furthermore, we need to think about this because if I keep interacting with you in the chat and that's what's causing you to F up and I need to interact with you through the CLI so this doesn't keep happening like if in the CLI stuff is being done in a more controlled manner to make sure that everything is being run properly every single time such as like when I do a certain command in the CLI it also attaches to a script that makes your response to go a certain way an flow and do everything that I want from the beginning all the way to the end till it goes and offers up to run the script or even auto runs the script for the looking back at your message and seeing all the tags and also doing the auto GIT commit

tag successfully routed the same content to both the architecture and conventions memory files.
Tracking System: The routing tracking system is working correctly, showing a history of recent routing operations including:
What content was routed
Which file it was routed to
When it was routed
The line number where the content was added
Debug Output: The debug logs show the message router correctly identified and processed all tags in our test message.
The system has some non-critical issues to note:
Desktop Notifications: There are errors with the notification system (plyer notification failed), but the script falls back to console notifications as designed.
Pattern Matching: Some standard patterns show "Standard match doesn't have enough groups" warnings, but this doesn't prevent content from being routed correctly.
Since the routing history shows our content was properly routed, and we can see the feature log file was created with the correct content, we can confirm that the message router is working correctly.
If you'd like, we can run another test with different tag types or make improvements to the notification system to resolve those errors.
It says that the Cursor watch is not working. Also, you didn't do the tags again meaning that you didn't run the script before you started. I think in your Cursor rules file you literally need to have instructions that tell you to run a script. And also you didn't run the script at the end of the response of yours or at least you didn't give me the option to run the script. And also you didn't do the get commit auto. And furthermore, we need to think about this because if I keep interacting with you in the chat and that's what's causing you to F up and I need to interact with you through the CLI so this doesn't keep happening like if in the CLI stuff is being done in a more controlled manner to make sure that everything is being run properly every single time such as like when I do a certain command in the CLI it also attaches to a script that makes your response to go a certain way an flow and do everything that I want from the beginning all the way to the end till it goes and offers up to run the script or even auto runs the script for the looking back at your message and seeing all the tags and also doing the auto GIT commit

tag successfully routed the same content to both the architecture and conventions memory files.
Tracking System: The routing tracking system is working correctly, showing a history of recent routing operations including:
What content was routed
Which file it was routed to
When it was routed
The line number where the content was added
Debug Output: The debug logs show the message router correctly identified and processed all tags in our test message.
The system has some non-critical issues to note:
Desktop Notifications: There are errors with the notification system (plyer notification failed), but the script falls back to console notifications as designed.
Pattern Matching: Some standard patterns show "Standard match doesn't have enough groups" warnings, but this doesn't prevent content from being routed correctly.
Since the routing history shows our content was properly routed, and we can see the feature log file was created with the correct content, we can confirm that the message router is working correctly.
If you'd like, we can run another test with different tag types or make improvements to the notification system to resolve those errors.

Debug Output: The debug logs show the message router correctly identified and processed all tags in our test message.
The system has some non-critical issues to note:
Desktop Notifications: There are errors with the notification system (plyer notification failed), but the script falls back to console notifications as designed.
Pattern Matching: Some standard patterns show "Standard match doesn't have enough groups" warnings, but this doesn't prevent content from being routed correctly.
Since the routing history shows our content was properly routed, and we can see the feature log file was created with the correct content, we can confirm that the message router is working correctly.
If you'd like, we can run another test with different tag types or make improvements to the notification system to resolve those errors.
It says that the Cursor watch is not working. Also, you didn't do the tags again meaning that you didn't run the script before you started. I think in your Cursor rules file you literally need to have instructions that tell you to run a script. And also you didn't run the script at the end of the response of yours or at least you didn't give me the option to run the script. And also you didn't do the get commit auto. And furthermore, we need to think about this because if I keep interacting with you in the chat and that's what's causing you to F up and I need to interact with you through the CLI so this doesn't keep happening like if in the CLI stuff is being done in a more controlled manner to make sure that everything is being run properly every single time such as like when I do a certain command in the CLI it also attaches to a script that makes your response to go a certain way an flow and do everything that I want from the beginning all the way to the end till it goes and offers up to run the script or even auto runs the script for the looking back at your message and seeing all the tags and also doing the auto GIT commit

Let's try a different approach. Let's create a completely new version of the script:

tag successfully routed the same content to both the architecture and conventions memory files.
Tracking System: The routing tracking system is working correctly, showing a history of recent routing operations including:
What content was routed
Which file it was routed to
When it was routed
The line number where the content was added
Debug Output: The debug logs show the message router correctly identified and processed all tags in our test message.
The system has some non-critical issues to note:
Desktop Notifications: There are errors with the notification system (plyer notification failed), but the script falls back to console notifications as designed.
Pattern Matching: Some standard patterns show "Standard match doesn't have enough groups" warnings, but this doesn't prevent content from being routed correctly.
Since the routing history shows our content was properly routed, and we can see the feature log file was created with the correct content, we can confirm that the message router is working correctly.
If you'd like, we can run another test with different tag types or make improvements to the notification system to resolve those errors.
It says that the Cursor watch is not working. Also, you didn't do the tags again meaning that you didn't run the script before you started. I think in your Cursor rules file you literally need to have instructions that tell you to run a script. And also you didn't run the script at the end of the response of yours or at least you didn't give me the option to run the script. And also you didn't do the get commit auto. And furthermore, we need to think about this because if I keep interacting with you in the chat and that's what's causing you to F up and I need to interact with you through the CLI so this doesn't keep happening like if in the CLI stuff is being done in a more controlled manner to make sure that everything is being run properly every single time such as like when I do a certain command in the CLI it also attaches to a script that makes your response to go a certain way an flow and do everything that I want from the beginning all the way to the end till it goes and offers up to run the script or even auto runs the script for the looking back at your message and seeing all the tags and also doing the auto GIT commit

You're absolutely right. There are several critical issues that need to be fixed immediately:

Let me try again with a more explicit edit:
There's something strange here. The code actually looks properly indented in the file, but the error message is still showing an indentation error. Let me try to completely rewrite this section of the file:
.
Let's try a different approach. Let's create a completely new version of the script:
Now let's create an auto-commit script for Git integration:
Let's create a .gitignore file to exclude unnecessary files:
Let's try creating the .gitignore without newlines:
Let's create the auto-commit script:
Let's create the auto-commit script file by file:
Let's make the script executable:
Now, let's update the README to include information about auto-commit functionality:

Let's see if the auto-commit functionality is already integrated into the case statement:
Let's look for the main switch case in the script:
Let's search for the auto-commit implementation:
Let's look at the auto-commit function in the remote script:

tag successfully routed the same content to both the architecture and conventions memory files.
Tracking System: The routing tracking system is working correctly, showing a history of recent routing operations including:
What content was routed
Which file it was routed to
When it was routed
The line number where the content was added
Debug Output: The debug logs show the message router correctly identified and processed all tags in our test message.
The system has some non-critical issues to note:
Desktop Notifications: There are errors with the notification system (plyer notification failed), but the script falls back to console notifications as designed.
Pattern Matching: Some standard patterns show "Standard match doesn't have enough groups" warnings, but this doesn't prevent content from being routed correctly.
Since the routing history shows our content was properly routed, and we can see the feature log file was created with the correct content, we can confirm that the message router is working correctly.
If you'd like, we can run another test with different tag types or make improvements to the notification system to resolve those errors.
It says that the Cursor watch is not working. Also, you didn't do the tags again meaning that you didn't run the script before you started. I think in your Cursor rules file you literally need to have instructions that tell you to run a script. And also you didn't run the script at the end of the response of yours or at least you didn't give me the option to run the script. And also you didn't do the get commit auto. And furthermore, we need to think about this because if I keep interacting with you in the chat and that's what's causing you to F up and I need to interact with you through the CLI so this doesn't keep happening like if in the CLI stuff is being done in a more controlled manner to make sure that everything is being run properly every single time such as like when I do a certain command in the CLI it also attaches to a script that makes your response to go a certain way an flow and do everything that I want from the beginning all the way to the end till it goes and offers up to run the script or even auto runs the script for the looking back at your message and seeing all the tags and also doing the auto GIT commit

Let's try a different approach. Let's create a completely new version of the script:
Now let's create an auto-commit script for Git integration:
Let's create a .gitignore file to exclude unnecessary files:
Let's try creating the .gitignore without newlines:
Let's create the auto-commit script:

Let's see if the auto-commit functionality is already integrated into the case statement:
Let's look for the main switch case in the script:
