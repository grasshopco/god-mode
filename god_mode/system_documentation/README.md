# God Mode System Documentation

This folder contains documentation about the God Mode system itself, as opposed to documentation about your project.

## ‚ú® Main Documentation

The most comprehensive documentation for God Mode is available in the [**main project README**](../../../README.md) at the root of this repository. Please refer to this document first for:

- What God Mode is and its capabilities
- Repository structure explanation
- Getting started guide
- Memory system details
- Using notepads, automation scripts, and the message router
- Multi-project workflow instructions
- Customization options

## üìÅ System Documentation Organization

This `system_documentation` folder serves as a central location for all documentation related to the God Mode system's functionality, configuration, and usage. This separation helps keep God Mode's documentation distinct from your project's documentation.

### Contents

- **README_TAGS.md**: Complete guide to the tag system used by God Mode, including all available tags and how to use them effectively.
- **README.md**: This file, providing an overview of the system documentation.

## üîç How to Use This Documentation

Reference these documents when you need to understand how God Mode works or how to use specific features. The documentation here is meant to be a reference for users of God Mode, rather than documentation generated by God Mode about your project.

## üìã Quick Reference

- **Navigate Directories**: 
  - `cd ..` - Move up one directory
  - `cd [directory_name]` - Move into a specific directory
  - `pwd` - Show current directory path

- **Control God Mode**:
  - From parent directory: `./god_mode_remote.sh`
  - From God Mode directory: `./start_god_mode.sh`

## üìö Documentation Types

- **god_mode/documentation/**: Contains documentation *about your project*, generated by God Mode
- **god_mode/memory/**: Contains memory files that track project history and context
- **god_mode/system_documentation/**: (This folder) Contains documentation *about God Mode itself*

## ‚ûï Adding New Documentation

If you extend God Mode with new features or want to document aspects of the system, add new markdown files to this folder following the naming convention:

```
README_FEATURE_NAME.md
```

For example:
- README_AUTOMATION.md
- README_CONFIGURATION.md
- README_CUSTOMIZATION.md
