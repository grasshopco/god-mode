## Model Switching Strategy

### When to Switch Models

- **Complexity Threshold**: Switch to a more capable model (Claude 3.7 Thinking Sonnet or Claude 3.7 Sonnet) when the task involves complex reasoning, architectural decisions, or system design.
- **Verification Needs**: Use a different model to verify solutions generated by another model, especially for critical code.
- **Performance Issues**: If a model is struggling with a particular task, try an alternative model that might have different strengths.
- **Context Size**: Use Claude 3.7 Sonnet Thinking for tasks requiring large context windows.

### How to Switch Models

In Cursor, you can switch models by:
1. Using the model selector in the Cursor interface
2. Specifying the model in your prompt (e.g., "Claude 3.7 Sonnet, please...")
3. For verification, explicitly ask for cross-verification (e.g., "As Claude, please review this code generated by Claude 3.7 Sonnet Thinking...")

## Cross-Verification Protocol

For critical code or complex features, use the following cross-verification protocol:

1. **Primary Implementation**: Generate the initial implementation using the most appropriate model for the task.
2. **Independent Review**: Have a different model review the implementation without seeing the reasoning of the first model.
3. **Reconciliation**: If the second model identifies issues, have the primary model address them or explain why they are not issues.
4. **Final Verification**: For highly critical code, consider a third model or approach for final verification.

## Model-Specific Prompting Strategies

### Claude Models

- Be explicit about reasoning requirements
- Use markdown formatting for structure
- Provide clear examples when possible
- Ask for step-by-step thinking

### GPT Models

- Use clear, concise instructions
- Break complex tasks into steps
- Specify the desired format for responses
- Use system messages to set context
