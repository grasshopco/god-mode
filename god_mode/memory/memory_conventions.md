## Conventions Coding Conventions

The following conventions have been established for Conventions development:

### Naming Conventions
- **Variables**: camelCase (e.g., `userData`, `apiResponse`)
- **Classes**: PascalCase (e.g., `UserRepository`, `AuthService`)
- **Constants**: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `MAX_RETRY_COUNT`, `API_BASE_URL`)
- **Private members**: Prefix with underscore (e.g., `_privateMethod`, `_internalState`)

### File Organization
- One class per file
- Group related files in feature-based directories
- Keep file size under 400 lines
- Separate test files in parallel directory structure

### Code Style
- Maximum line length: 100 characters
- Indentation: 2 spaces
- Use explicit type annotations
- Always use curly braces for control structures

These conventions are enforced through linting and code reviews.

The project now uses a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns.
Each module follows the repository pattern with standard naming conventions.
```

This will route the content to:
- MEMORY_CURSOR.md
- memory_architecture.md
- memory_conventions.md

### Example 2: Route to Logs and Features
