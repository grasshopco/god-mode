## 2025-03-04: System-wide Bug Fixes and Improvements

We addressed several critical issues in the God Mode system:

1. **Message Router Bug Fix**: Fixed the "too many values to unpack" error in the message router's validate_message function. The bug was causing failures when validating clipboard content. The fix implements a more robust validation approach with improved error handling.

2. **System Verification Implementation**: Created a comprehensive system verification tool that checks the status of all God Mode components and provides actionable recommendations. This tool helps diagnose issues with cursor_watch, message_router, cursor_rules, memory files, and auto-commit functionality.

3. **Tag Detection Enhancement**: Improved the tag detection mechanism in cursor_watch to ensure consistent and reliable identification of messages needing tags. The implementation now correctly identifies substantive messages that should have tags and logs detailed information for debugging.

4. **Auto-Commit Functionality**: Implemented an auto-commit script that automatically commits changes to memory files and other tracked files at the end of a conversation. This ensures that changes to memory and other important files are preserved.

5. **Memory File Structure**: Created proper structure for memory files including feature_log.md and log_summary.md to maintain consistent documentation.

These improvements significantly enhance the reliability and functionality of the God Mode system, making it more robust for daily use.
