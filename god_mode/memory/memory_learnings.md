# Learnings

This file records insights, lessons learned, and important discoveries made during the development of the Grasshop project. It serves as a knowledge repository for improving future work.

## General Learnings

- [2024-03-30] **Cursor God Mode Setup**: Setting up a comprehensive context system with rules, memory files, and specialized notepads significantly improves AI understanding of the project and enables more autonomous operation.

## Architecture Learnings

- [2024-03-30] **Notepad Organization**: Separating documentation into specialized notepads (UI guidelines, architecture, common patterns) rather than a single large document improves maintainability and makes it easier to reference specific information.

## Development Practices

- [2024-03-30] **Two-Tier Logging**: Implementing a two-tier logging system (summarized + detailed) provides both quick overview and in-depth documentation without overwhelming either file.

## Learnings Implementation Learnings

Key learnings from the Learnings implementation:

### Technical Learnings
1. **Early Performance Testing**: Identifying performance bottlenecks early saved significant refactoring time later.
2. **Type Safety**: TypeScript's strict mode prevented numerous runtime errors that would have been difficult to debug.
3. **Test-Driven Development**: Writing tests first led to better API design and more maintainable code.

### Process Learnings
1. **Continuous Integration**: Small, frequent commits reduced merge conflicts and integration issues.
2. **Documentation First**: Writing documentation before implementation clarified requirements and identified edge cases.
3. **Cross-Functional Collaboration**: Early involvement of design and QA teams improved quality and reduced rework.

These learnings will be applied to future development initiatives.

## Learnings Retrospective Insights

The following insights were gained from the Learnings project retrospective:

### What Went Well
- Modular architecture allowed for parallel development
- Automated testing caught regression issues early
- Regular stakeholder demos kept the project aligned with expectations
- Clear documentation reduced onboarding time for new team members

### Areas for Improvement
- Initial estimates were overly optimistic
- Third-party integration complexity was underestimated
- Technical debt accumulated in early sprints
- Knowledge silos formed around specific components

### Action Items
1. Implement more realistic estimation techniques
2. Create integration risk assessment process
3. Schedule regular technical debt reduction sprints
4. Implement pair programming and knowledge sharing sessions

These insights have been incorporated into our updated development practices.
