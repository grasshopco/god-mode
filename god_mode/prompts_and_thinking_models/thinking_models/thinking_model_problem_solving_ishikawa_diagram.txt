Ishikawa Diagram
PROBLEM SOLVING
Identify root causes of problems.
Ishikawa diagram is a great tool to help you solve problems by identifying their root causes. Sometimes called also cause-and-effect or fishbone diagram, it was created by Japanese professor Kaoru Ishikawa. It's especially effective for tackling complex problems.

Example of an Ishikawa diagram
How to use it
Building out this diagram consists of few simple steps. This can be done in a group as a workshop but also just as well on your own.

1) Define the problem
Start with defining the problem and then drawing a line to the left or right of it (that's up to your preference).

The line will be for adding factors in the next step.

2) Identify contributing factors or categories
List out the factors/categories that could be contributing to the problem you're solving. Plot them along the main line.

You can come up with your own factors or you might use generic categories: People, Equipments, Methods, Measurement, Material and Environment.

Categorising is very helpful for breaking down complex problems and looking at them from different perspectives.

3) Find possible root causes related to each factor
Ask "Why is this happening?" Write down each idea as a line under the factor it relates to. First principles thinking is useful here including the "Five whys" method.

Keep in mind that the problem might not have just one root cause but multiple. So it's important to capture everything that might explain the problem, even if just partially.

At this point, you should have a complete diagram but no definitive answer yet.

4) Analyse the diagram
The most important step is looking at all the possible root causes and analysing them. The diagram now provides a structure for your most important thinking and next steps.

There are many possibilities what you can do at this point. Perhaps you can gather more data/evidence for each root cause candidate or immediately identify the most likely one and quickly try to solve it. This will depend on your specific problems and identified possible causes. 

Example
Now let's see how to apply this on a practical example.

Suppose you're a product manager and have to solve a trend of getting less and less new sign-ups. You start with this definition and then identify contributing factors.

Ishikawa diagram with capture contributing factors
In this example, you identified landing page issues, competition and marketing as factors.

Now let's find specific possible root causes under each factor:

Example of an Ishikawa diagram
With all of these written down, you can begin to analyse where the problem originates. In this example, you might first verify if the conversion rate is steady despite lower traffic. Then you might audit your sign-up flow to find any leaks and possibly streamline it.

This is a simplified example but this diagram can be definitely used for much more complex problems.

Takeaway
Ishikawa diagram offers a simple framework for finding root causes of problems:

Define the problem
Identify contributing factors or categories
Find possible root causes related to each factor
Analyse the diagram
You'll create the diagram with the first three steps. It will then provide a structure for your analysis.









[MUSIC PLAYING]  DAVE WILLIAMS: A common challenge for improvement teams is identifying what changes you can test to improve a process or problem. One great method to help you break down ideas is a tool known as a "cause-and-effect diagram." You may have also heard of this tool referred to as an "Ishikawa diagram"-- attributed to its creator, Kaouru Ishikawa-- or a "fishbone diagram" because of the resemblance to the bones of a fish. To create a cause-and-effect diagram, write the effect in a box on the right-hand side of the page.

So let's imagine we're working on improving hand-washing.  All right. Then draw a horizontal line across the page.  Decide on a few categories or causes for the problem. Useful categories of causes in the classic fishbone diagram include people, methods, materials, equipment, and environment.  Then we can draw a diagonal line to each of these, and these are actually the bones of the fish-- and hence, its name.  The process of categorizing potential causes may be very useful to help you to break down a complex problem

and focus in on it from various perspectives. So as you're looking at each of the categories, you want to generate a list of causes. In this example, people might include clinical staff.  All right. It also might include non-clinical staff.  Let's put them as just "other staff." It might include the methods. How do you actually wash your hands?  I'll say "wash process." It could be the materials. Are you using the right kind of soap, or does it dry out your hands? So we'll think about the soap.

It could be the equipment, like the dispenser.  Is there an easy dispenser to use? Does it give you the right amount? Or maybe it's the environment. Where is the dispenser location? Is it near the process of care? Identify the causes by asking why with people that are closest to the process until you've reached a useful level of detail. That is when the cause is specific enough to be able to test a change and to measure its effects. Sometimes, I like to describe this for folks that have children as the five-year-old method.

If you ever had a kid, they asked you "why" five times constantly until they get to the root of the problem. And you're doing the same thing here.
