<LOG_SUMMARY>This is a test response to verify godmode-process script functionality.</LOG_SUMMARY>

<LOG_DETAIL>
This response is testing the godmode and godmode-process scripts to make sure they work correctly. The specific test goals are:
1. Verify that enhanced prompts are generated correctly
2. Test that XML tags are properly recognized and processed
3. Ensure that the content is routed to the correct memory files
</LOG_DETAIL>

<MEMORY_UPDATE>
The godmode.sh and godmode-process.sh scripts have been implemented as standalone scripts that can be run from any directory. This approach avoids the permission issues caused by searching through protected directories.
</MEMORY_UPDATE>

<FEATURE: GodModeConsistency>
The GodModeConsistency feature now includes standalone scripts for better usability. These scripts ensure proper XML tag formatting and consistent application of God Mode rules.
</FEATURE: GodModeConsistency>

<PROMPT_ENHANCEMENT>
The user requested a simple test message. For future responses, I should:
1. Acknowledge that this was just a test
2. Keep explanations concise for test scenarios
3. Focus on confirming whether the test was successful
</PROMPT_ENHANCEMENT>
