I've made significant updates to the project structure and implemented the message router script.

[LOG_SUMMARY]Implemented message router script and reorganized project structure for God Mode enhancement

[LOG_DETAIL]
# Message Router Implementation Complete

The message router script is now fully functional with the following capabilities:
- Processes input from files, direct text, or clipboard
- Routes content based on special markers
- Adds timestamps to all entries
- Creates target files if they don't exist
- Handles special cases for feature logs and documentation updates

Additionally, reorganized the project structure to better organize documentation, templates, and scripts.

[MEMORY_UPDATE]
The God Mode project now has a message router script (script_message_router.py) that automatically routes content to the appropriate files based on special markers. The script can be run directly or using the "route" bash script. This will be important for maintaining organized documentation.

[FEATURE_LOG: Message Router]
Initial implementation of the message router system complete. The system now processes marked sections of text and routes them to the appropriate files with proper formatting and timestamps.

[DOC_UPDATE: tools]
## Message Router

The message router is a utility script that processes AI outputs and routes content to appropriate documentation files based on special markers. 

Usage examples:
```bash
# Process a file
./route --input path/to/message.txt

# Process text directly
./route --message "[LOG_SUMMARY]This is a summary entry."

# Process clipboard content
./route --clipboard

# Watch clipboard for changes
./route --watch
```

See the README_message_router.md file for complete documentation.

[LEARNING]
Creating a message router system significantly improves documentation organization by automating the process of updating various logs and documentation files, reducing manual copying and pasting, and ensuring consistent formatting with timestamps.

[PROMPT_LEARNING]
When requesting complex scripts like the message router, it's helpful to clearly define the expected behavior, input/output formats, and intended use cases. This provides sufficient context for implementing comprehensive solutions.

[DISCUSSION]
The message router script is a foundational tool for the enhanced God Mode workflow. It bridges the gap between AI interactions and structured documentation by automatically processing and categorizing AI outputs. 

Next steps could include:
1. Integrating the script into the overall workflow more tightly
2. Adding support for additional markers for more specialized routing
3. Creating visualization tools for the accumulated documentation
