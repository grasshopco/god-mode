## Glossary Domain Language Standardization

To improve communication consistency, the following domain-specific terms for Glossary have been standardized:

### User vs. Account
- **User**: A person who interacts with the system
- **Account**: The collection of data and permissions associated with a user

### Session vs. Token
- **Session**: Server-side storage of authentication state
- **Token**: Client-side representation of authentication state

### Event vs. Action
- **Event**: Something that has happened in the system
- **Action**: Something that a user or system initiates

### View vs. Page
- **View**: A UI component that displays data
- **Page**: A complete screen composed of multiple views

This standardization helps reduce misunderstandings in requirements and implementation.
