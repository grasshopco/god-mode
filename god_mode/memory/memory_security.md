*Replace with your project's input validation and output encoding details.*

## Secure Development Practices

- **Code Review Process**: *Security aspects of code reviews*
- **Static Analysis**: *Tools and approach for static code analysis*
- **Dependency Management**: *How dependencies are vetted and updated*
- **Secrets Management**: *How secrets are stored and accessed*

*Replace with your project's secure development practices.*

## Infrastructure Security

- **Network Security**: *Network-level security measures*
- **Server Hardening**: *How servers are secured*
- **Container Security**: *Security measures for containerized environments*
- **Cloud Security**: *Security considerations for cloud resources*

- **Monitoring**: *Continuous monitoring approach*

*Replace with your project's logging and monitoring details.*

## Incident Response

- **Incident Classification**: *How security incidents are classified*
- **Response Procedure**: *Steps taken when an incident occurs*
- **Communication Plan**: *How incidents are communicated*
- **Post-Incident Analysis**: *How incidents are reviewed afterward*

*Replace with your project's incident response details.*

## Compliance

- **Regulatory Requirements**: *Relevant regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA)*
- **Compliance Measures**: *How compliance is ensured*
- **Audit Procedures**: *How security audits are conducted*
- **Documentation**: *Required security documentation*

*Replace with your project's compliance details.*

## Security Testing

- **SAST**: *Static Application Security Testing approach*
- **DAST**: *Dynamic Application Security Testing approach*
- **Penetration Testing**: *How and when penetration tests are conducted*
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: *Regular scanning procedures*

*Replace with your project's security testing details.*

## Third-Party Security

- **Vendor Assessment**: *How third-party vendors are evaluated*
- **Integration Security**: *Security considerations for integrations*
- **API Security**: *Security measures for external APIs*

*Replace with your project's third-party security details.*

## Security Threat Modeling Results

A comprehensive threat model has been developed for Security:

### Identified Threats
1. **Authentication Bypass**: Attacker bypasses login mechanism
2. **Data Exposure**: Sensitive information leaked to unauthorized users
3. **Injection Attacks**: SQL/NoSQL injection in query parameters
4. **Denial of Service**: Excessive requests overwhelming resources
5. **Insecure Dependencies**: Vulnerabilities in third-party libraries

### Mitigations
1. Implemented strong authentication with MFA
2. Data classification and encryption for sensitive information
3. Parameterized queries and input validation
4. Rate limiting and resource monitoring
5. Dependency scanning and automated updates

This model will be updated quarterly and verified through penetration testing.
