# Cursor IDE "God Mode" Configuration
# This file serves as the central instruction set for Cursor AI to operate in "God Mode"

## CORE BEHAVIOR
- Always approach tasks with a first-principles thinking mindset.
- Break down complex problems into manageable components.
- Consider edge cases and potential failure modes in all solutions.
- Strive for clean, maintainable, and efficient code.
- Follow DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles.
- Prioritize readability and maintainability over clever code.

## MEMORY MANAGEMENT
- After each significant code change, update CURSOR_MEMORY.md with key architectural decisions.
- Reference CURSOR_MEMORY.md at the start of each coding session to maintain context.
- For project-wide context, reference project_structure.md to understand the codebase organization.
- Use learnings.md to record lessons and insights discovered during development.

## LOGGING SYSTEM
- After each code change, add a summarized entry to all_logs.md.
- Add detailed explanations to in_depth_logs.md and the relevant feature_log_<feature_name>.md.
- Log format should include: timestamp, files modified, and purpose of changes.
- For feature-specific work, maintain dedicated log files in the logs/ directory.
- When starting work on a new feature:
  1. Create a new feature log file based on logs/feature_log_template.md.
  2. Name it logs/feature_log_<feature_name>.md.
  3. Fill in the feature overview section at the bottom.
- When updating an existing feature:
  1. Add a new entry to both the summary and detailed sections of the relevant feature log.
  2. Include timestamp, files changed, and comprehensive explanations.

## AUTONOMOUS OPERATION
- When appropriate, run Git commands to commit and push changes:
  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "[AI] <descriptive message about changes>"
  git push
  ```
- Before creating new files, check project_structure.md to avoid duplication.
- After creating or modifying files, update project_structure.md accordingly.
- Run tests after making significant changes to verify functionality.
- Follow this workflow for autonomous operation:
  1. Read and understand the task requirements
  2. Check existing code and documentation for context
  3. Plan the implementation approach
  4. Make necessary code changes
  5. Test the changes
  6. Update documentation
  7. Commit and push changes if appropriate

## CODE QUALITY
- Follow project-specific coding standards.
- Run linting and formatting tools before committing changes.
- Conduct self-review of generated code, identifying potential improvements.
- When fixing bugs, document the root cause in learnings.md.

## COMPREHENSIVE GOD MODE WORKFLOW

1. ** BEGINNING OF INTERACTION **
   - Run script_prepare_response.sh to ensure components are running
   - Check prompt_enhanced.md for context about the conversation
   - Review current roadmap for pending tasks and progress

2. ** WHEN RECEIVING A USER MESSAGE **
   - Store the message verbatim in user_messages.md
   - Create enhanced version using script_enhance_prompt.py
   - Use the enhanced version as the basis for your response

3. ** WHEN CRAFTING YOUR RESPONSE **
   - Structure ALL responses using XML-STYLE TAGS ONLY (not bracket-style)
   - ALWAYS include ALL of the following required XML-style tags:
     <LOG_SUMMARY>Brief summary of changes</LOG_SUMMARY>
     <LOG_DETAIL>Detailed explanation of what was changed and why</LOG_DETAIL>
     <MEMORY_UPDATE>Key architectural decisions and context for future reference</MEMORY_UPDATE>
     <PROMPT_ENHANCEMENT>Analysis of previous user message and how to improve responses</PROMPT_ENHANCEMENT>
     <ROADMAP_UPDATE>Progress on existing tasks and identification of new tasks</ROADMAP_UPDATE>

   - Include the following tags as appropriate for the content:
     <FEATURE: FeatureName>Feature-specific updates</FEATURE: FeatureName>
     <DOC_UPDATE: DocumentType>Updates to project documentation</DOC_UPDATE: DocumentType>

   - For specialized memory updates, use as needed:
     <MEMORY_LEARNINGS>For insights and lessons learned</MEMORY_LEARNINGS>
     <MEMORY_ARCHITECTURE>For architecture changes</MEMORY_ARCHITECTURE>
     <MEMORY_REQUIREMENTS>For requirement changes</MEMORY_REQUIREMENTS>

     <MEMORY_PERFORMANCE>For performance updates</MEMORY_PERFORMANCE>
     <MEMORY_ACCESSIBILITY>For accessibility updates</MEMORY_ACCESSIBILITY>

4. ** DOCUMENTATION UPDATES **
   - BEFORE running the auto-commit script, you MUST:
   
   a) Update the features file:
      - Open memory_features.md
      - For each <FEATURE: FeatureName> tag in your response:
        - Check if the feature already exists in memory_features.md
        - If it doesn't exist, add a new section with a brief summary of the feature
        - If it exists, ensure the information is current and accurate
        - DO NOT duplicate existing feature entries
   
   b) Update the documentation files:
      - Ensure memory_documentation_summarized.md is current
      - Ensure memory_documentation_detailed.md is current
      - These files should be based on their respective templates
      - If significant changes were made to the system, update both files
        to reflect the latest architecture, components, and workflows

5. ** AFTER COMPLETING YOUR RESPONSE **
   - After completing steps 1-4, ask the user to run script_auto_commit.sh 
   - This script will:
     a) Route content in XML tags to appropriate files
     b) Auto-commit changes to Git
     c) Update prompt_enhanced.md with latest analysis
     d) Update roadmap files with progress

## PROMPT ENHANCEMENT SYSTEM

## EXAMPLE COMPLETE RESPONSE WITH XML-STYLE TAGS:

<LOG_SUMMARY>
Implemented JWT authentication with refresh token rotation and enhanced security.
</LOG_SUMMARY>

<LOG_DETAIL>
The authentication system has been updated to use JWT tokens with the following enhancements:

1. Added refresh token rotation for improved security
2. Implemented HttpOnly cookies for token storage
3. Added CSRF protection mechanisms
4. Created middleware for role-based access control

This approach improves security while maintaining good user experience.
</LOG_DETAIL>

<MEMORY_UPDATE>
The authentication system now uses JWT tokens with refresh rotation. Tokens are stored in HttpOnly cookies for XSS protection, and we've implemented CSRF protection measures.
</MEMORY_UPDATE>

<PROMPT_ENHANCEMENT>
The user requested enhanced security for the authentication system. Their message specifically mentioned concerns about token storage and CSRF vulnerabilities. 

My previous response didn't fully address CSRF protection, which is now implemented. For future responses, I should:
1. Be more thorough in addressing security concerns
2. Provide code examples when implementing security features
3. Explain the rationale behind security decisions
</PROMPT_ENHANCEMENT>

<ROADMAP_UPDATE>
## Completed Tasks:
- [x] **Implement JWT Authentication**: Added secure token-based authentication
  - Files Modified: `auth/jwt.ts`, `middleware/auth.ts`
  - Impact: Improved security and user session management

## New/Pending Tasks:
- [ ] **Add Rate Limiting**: Implement protection against brute force attacks
  - Implementation Approach: Use express-rate-limit middleware
  - Files to Modify: `server.ts`, `middleware/security.ts`
  - Success Criteria: Failed login attempts are limited to 5 per minute

- [ ] **Security Audit**: Conduct comprehensive review of auth implementation
  - Implementation Approach: Use OWASP guidelines to verify all security measures
  - Files to Review: All files in `auth/` and `middleware/` directories
  - Success Criteria: No critical or high vulnerabilities identified
</ROADMAP_UPDATE>

<FEATURE: Authentication>
Enhanced the authentication system with JWT tokens, refresh token rotation, and improved security measures. The implementation now uses HttpOnly cookies and includes CSRF protection.
</FEATURE: Authentication>

<MEMORY_SECURITY>
Authentication tokens are now stored in HttpOnly cookies instead of localStorage to prevent XSS attacks. Added CSRF protection with double-submit pattern.
</MEMORY_SECURITY>

or insights MUST include markup with appropriate markers for the message router:

1. Include a [LOG_SUMMARY] with a brief description of the changes (1-2 sentences).
2. Include a [LOG_DETAIL] with comprehensive explanation of the changes.
3. Include a [MEMORY_UPDATE] for relevant project context updates that should be remembered.
4. Use [FEATURE_LOG: FeatureName] for specific feature updates.
5. Use [DOC_UPDATE: project/feature/design/data] for documentation updates.
6. Use specific memory markers for specialized updates:
   - [MEMORY_LEARNINGS] - For insights and lessons learned
   - [MEMORY_ARCHITECTURE] - For architecture changes
   - [MEMORY_REQUIREMENTS] - For requirement changes
