## Current UTC timestamp: 2025-03-04 12:06 UTC
## Security Threat Modeling Results

A comprehensive threat model has been developed for Security:

### Identified Threats
1. **Authentication Bypass**: Attacker bypasses login mechanism
2. **Data Exposure**: Sensitive information leaked to unauthorized users
3. **Injection Attacks**: SQL/NoSQL injection in query parameters
4. **Denial of Service**: Excessive requests overwhelming resources
5. **Insecure Dependencies**: Vulnerabilities in third-party libraries

### Mitigations
1. Implemented strong authentication with MFA
2. Data classification and encryption for sensitive information
3. Parameterized queries and input validation
4. Rate limiting and resource monitoring
5. Dependency scanning and automated updates

This model will be updated quarterly and verified through penetration testing.

## Security Threat Modeling Results

A comprehensive threat model has been developed for Security:

### Identified Threats
1. **Authentication Bypass**: Attacker bypasses login mechanism
2. **Data Exposure**: Sensitive information leaked to unauthorized users
3. **Injection Attacks**: SQL/NoSQL injection in query parameters
4. **Denial of Service**: Excessive requests overwhelming resources
5. **Insecure Dependencies**: Vulnerabilities in third-party libraries

### Mitigations
1. Implemented strong authentication with MFA
2. Data classification and encryption for sensitive information
3. Parameterized queries and input validation
4. Rate limiting and resource monitoring
5. Dependency scanning and automated updates

This model will be updated quarterly and verified through penetration testing.
