# God Mode Features Summary

This file maintains a summary of all features implemented in the God Mode system.

## Core Features

### Message Router
The message router processes tagged content from AI responses and routes it to appropriate files based on tag type. It supports XML-style tags with explicit opening and closing markers, providing clear content boundaries and the ability to route content verbatim without transformation.

### Memory Manager
The memory manager handles persistent storage of all knowledge across development sessions. It maintains a structured file hierarchy with specialized files for different types of content, ensuring information is properly organized and easily accessible.

### Prompt Enhancer
The prompt enhancer improves user messages by adding relevant context from project structure, memory files, and recent activity. It maintains versions of enhanced prompts, enabling continuous improvement of the AI's context awareness.

### Workflow Automation
The workflow automation system handles pre-response preparation and post-response processing through automated scripts. It verifies system components, ensures memory file integrity, processes tagged content, and commits changes to version control.

### Documentation Generator
The documentation generator creates and maintains system documentation using standardized templates. It produces both summarized and detailed documentation, tracks features, and maintains a comprehensive record of the system's capabilities.

## Auxiliary Features

### Version Control Integration
The version control integration automatically commits changes to Git after each significant update. It creates meaningful commit messages, pushes to remote repositories, and maintains a complete history of all knowledge and code changes.

### XML Tag Processing
The XML tag processing system handles the identification and extraction of content from XML-style tags. It supports tag attributes, nested tag structures, and verbatim content preservation, ensuring precise routing of information.

### Feature Tracking
The feature tracking system maintains a comprehensive record of all implemented features. It preserves feature details, implementation notes, and rationale, creating a complete knowledge base of the system's capabilities.

### Roadmap Management
The roadmap management system tracks development progress, completed tasks, and upcoming work. It automatically updates based on tagged content in AI responses, providing real-time visibility into project status.

### Session Continuity
The session continuity system ensures perfect persistence of context between development sessions. It prepares summaries of recent activity, provides access to memory files, and maintains a continuous development experience.

## System Features

### Self-Improvement
The self-improvement capability analyzes past interactions to enhance future responses. It identifies areas for improvement, suggests refinements, and maintains a record of enhancement history, creating a continuously evolving system.

### Verbatim Content Preservation
The verbatim content preservation ensures that all content is saved exactly as written, without transformation or interpretation. This maintains the original intent and precise wording of all communications.

### Structured Communication
The structured communication system uses XML-style tags to explicitly mark different types of content. It enforces consistent tagging, ensures proper routing, and creates a clear structure for all significant information.

### Auto-Documentation
The auto-documentation feature automatically updates system documentation based on tagged content in AI responses. It maintains both summarized and detailed documentation, ensuring comprehensive system documentation is always current.

### Component Monitoring
The component monitoring system verifies that all God Mode components are running properly. It provides status information, starts stopped components, and ensures system integrity for optimal operation.
