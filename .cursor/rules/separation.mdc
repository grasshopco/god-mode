# Separation Rules
- **Single Responsibility:**
Each file should represent one distinct unit of work.
- **Component Breakdown: **
Break features into self-contained components.
- **Use Hooks:**
Encapsulate logic and data access in custom hooks.
- **Global vs. Local:**
- **Global:** Place reusable components and hooks in shared/global folders.
- **Local:** Keep object-specific components and hooks in localized folders.
- **Separation of Concerns:**
Maintain clear boundaries when creating or refactoring files.
- **Readable and Declarative Code:**
Rendered code should be very legible and clear. It should not include flow logic or ternary operators where possible.
- **Try to avoid index.ts as a linking file only:**
I hate an index file that simply exports another file. There is no reason this should happen. The index file should contain the contents it is exporting if it is simply acting as a proxy for 1 file -- unless there is real expectation that future growth will occur.
