Let's fix this:
Now let's look at how the feature log pattern is handled:
Let's examine the function that processes feature logs in the message router:
Let's also check how feature logs are detected and extracted:
Now I'll fix the script to use the correct naming pattern:
Let's also update the pattern to detect

Now, let's create a rename script to fix the existing file names:
Let's rename all these files:
Let's try again with the command on a single line:
Now let's update some other files that reference the old naming pattern. Let's start with the check_feature_logs script:
Now let's update the script_enhance_message_content.py file:
Let's also update any relevant documentation files to reflect the new naming pattern:
Let's also update the system documentation:
Let's also update the message router usage documentation:

Thought Process
Now that we've successfully updated the feature log file naming convention and tag format, let's address the issue with memory files containing repetitive, meaningless log entries. This is a critical issue that's preventing the memory system from being truly useful.
Let's implement a solution to make sure new log entries contain meaningful content:
Let's check the script_enhance_message_content.py file to understand how it generates content:
Let's see the full implementation of this enhance message content script since it has linter errors:
Let's fix the linter errors in the script_enhance_message_content.py file:
Now let's create a script to verify the memory file content functionality is working correctly:
Great! Let's now check if the feature logs are properly following the template structure:
Let's fix the feature log files to follow the template structure:
Let's check one of the feature log files to ensure it has been properly structured:
Let's check one more file that had issues with repetitive log entries to ensure it's been fixed:
Now, let's check if the project structure has file descriptions:
Let's check if we have a session continuity script for maintaining context between sessions:
Great! Let's run the session continuity script to generate a summary for maintaining context between sessions:
Now let's check if all the memory files have been correctly updated with meaningful content:
Let's check a couple of feature logs to verify they're using the correct naming pattern and following the template:
Finally, let's run a system test to make sure everything is working properly:
Excellent! We've successfully fixed all the issues with the God Mode system:
✅ Fixed Feature Log Naming Convention: We updated all feature log files to use the correct pattern memory_feature_*.md instead of memory_log_feature_*.md.
✅ Updated Tag Format: We changed the tag format from

Now, let's create a rename script to fix the existing file names:
Let's rename all these files:
Let's try again with the command on a single line:
Now let's update some other files that reference the old naming pattern. Let's start with the check_feature_logs script:
Now let's update the script_enhance_message_content.py file:
Let's also update any relevant documentation files to reflect the new naming pattern:
Let's also update the system documentation:
Let's also update the message router usage documentation:
you can continue

Thought Process
Now that we've successfully updated the feature log file naming convention and tag format, let's address the issue with memory files containing repetitive, meaningless log entries. This is a critical issue that's preventing the memory system from being truly useful.
Let's implement a solution to make sure new log entries contain meaningful content:
Let's check the script_enhance_message_content.py file to understand how it generates content:
Let's see the full implementation of this enhance message content script since it has linter errors:
Let's fix the linter errors in the script_enhance_message_content.py file:
Now let's create a script to verify the memory file content functionality is working correctly:
Great! Let's now check if the feature logs are properly following the template structure:
Let's fix the feature log files to follow the template structure:
Let's check one of the feature log files to ensure it has been properly structured:
Let's check one more file that had issues with repetitive log entries to ensure it's been fixed:
Now, let's check if the project structure has file descriptions:
Let's check if we have a session continuity script for maintaining context between sessions:
Great! Let's run the session continuity script to generate a summary for maintaining context between sessions:
Now let's check if all the memory files have been correctly updated with meaningful content:
Let's check a couple of feature logs to verify they're using the correct naming pattern and following the template:
Finally, let's run a system test to make sure everything is working properly:
Excellent! We've successfully fixed all the issues with the God Mode system:
✅ Fixed Feature Log Naming Convention: We updated all feature log files to use the correct pattern memory_feature_*.md instead of memory_log_feature_*.md.
✅ Updated Tag Format: We changed the tag format from

Let's fix this:
Now let's look at how the feature log pattern is handled:
Let's examine the function that processes feature logs in the message router:
Let's also check how feature logs are detected and extracted:
Now I'll fix the script to use the correct naming pattern:
Let's also update the pattern to detect
