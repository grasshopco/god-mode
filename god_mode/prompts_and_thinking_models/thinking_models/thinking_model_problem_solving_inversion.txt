Inversion
PROBLEM SOLVING
Approach a problem from a different point of view.
Inversion is useful when you need to view the problem you're solving from a different angle. It can help you see a different perspective and imagine worst-case scenarios.

How to use it?
A good trigger question to know if inversion can help you is "Am I only thinking of ideal solutions or scenarios?"

You can then invert your thinking about the problem or a solution. To do that, follow these steps:

Ask yourself: What would be the worst decision/solution in this situation?
Ask yourself: Why would it be bad? Write those reasons down.
Try to come up with a good decision/solution, now by looking at the reasons that would make a bad decision.
Illustration of inversion
Inversion helps you see the bad outcomes and therefore avoid them.

More questions that could help you see the inverted perspective are:

How could this go wrong?
What would the opposite of this be?
What would make a bad solution to this?
Inversion in practice
Project managers use inversion in an exercise called pre-mortem. 

The team gathers to imagine it's six months from now and the project they've worked on has failed. They examine this potential scenario by asking questions like "What went wrong?", "What mistakes did we make?" or "Why did this project fail?".

This makes the team see potential pitfalls ahead of time and prepare for them. By using inversion, they're able to avoid possible mistakes and bad outcomes.

Curious about product design at Dropbox? Here’s a look at tools we use for solving problems, making decisions, and communicating ideas.

A few years ago, I was getting ready to present some new designs to a few executives for review. The research was thorough. The interactions were thoughtful. The pixels were polished.

But as I started to explain our team’s design direction, things went south. People were slightly confused and weren’t sure how we were making decisions. Ultimately, they had a hard time buying in, and it was all on me.

After the review, I realized that:

I hadn’t shown how we solved the problem
I hadn’t created a clear decision framework
I hadn’t crafted a narrative around our solution
Turns out, there’s a lot more to being a designer than designing.

So how can you operate outside of your core design skills? Use mental models: simple explanations of how something in the world works. Like supply and demand, which helps us understand the economy, or the Pareto Principle, which helps us understand cause and effect.

To get you started, I’ve put together a set of seven of my favorite mental models that I use daily as a designer. They’ll help you solve problems, make decisions, and communicate ideas.

Models for problem-solving
First principles

Do you need an innovative solution to a complex problem? Try approaching the problem from first principles.

To do this, take your problem and:

Break it down into its fundamental parts
Reconfigure those parts to build a solution
Problem and solution
I did this on a project last year where we started with our problem statement. From there, I broke it down into its fundamental parts, then addressed each part, and reconfigured it to build up a solution. More on first princples here.

Inversion

Are you solving for only the best-case scenario? Try inversion to get a 360-degree view of your problem. To do this, instead of thinking of ideal solutions, think of bad solutions then ask yourself, “How might we avoid these?”

This method is great in situations when you want to approach a problem from an alternative point of view, or when you want to make sure you avoid worst-case scenarios.

Inversion map
We did this with our Customer Experience team, which handles all of customer support. Before the project started, we met with two of our top-tier agents, and they helped us brainstorm all the ways in which the feature could potentially go wrong for our users. They helped us round out our view of the problem, instead of locking in to an early idea. Read more examples of inversion here.

Pre-Moretem
Abstraction laddering

Want to make sure you see the forest for the trees? Try abstraction laddering to get above your problem.

Abstraction laddering
Start with your original problem statement: Design a better can opener
Then ask “how” questions to get to more concrete statements. How might we design a better can opener? → Make it more appealing. Paint it red and add a bow!
You can also ask “why” questions to get more abstract statements. Why might someone need a can opener? → To get soup out of a can
Now ask “how” from a higher level How might we design a better way to get soup out of a can → We could redesign the top of the can itself to be a pop top
why how cycle
Models for decision-making
Hard choice model

What kind of decision are you making? The hard choice model is a great way to figure this out.

Take your decision and look at:

How impactful the decision is
How easy it is to compare the options
Hard Choices
I find that many times I think I’m making a Hard Choice, but in reality it’s a Big Choice or an Apples/Oranges Choice. This framework can help you differentiate between these types of decisions.

Confidence decides speed vs. quality

Should you be optimizing for speed or quality? This is a question we ask ourselves a lot. And it comes down to two things: your confidence that you’re solving the right problem, and your confidence in the solution you’re designing.

Confidence Map
Low confidence in the importance of the problem? Focus on speed.
High confidence in the problem but low confidence in your solution? Focus equally on speed and quality.
High confidence in the problem and the solution? Focus on quality.
More on this model from Brandon Chu here.

Models for communicating
What, so what, now what?

Are you giving quick feedback? What, so what, now what is a lightweight way to structure your feedback.

So what now
The diamond model

Are you preparing long-form content (like presentations or big docs)? The diamond model works great for putting a structure around your main idea.

Diamond Model
Attention: Start with a story, statistic, or something similar
Main topic: Briefly introduce the main topic you’ll cover
Previews: Give quick previews of your subtopics
Subtopics: Go into depth with your subtopics
Summaries: Recap your subtopics
Conclusion: Paint an ideal vision of the future
Call to action: Invite your audience to act or make a decision
Try them out
These models are valuable only if they’re used. So when you’re at your desk this week and trying to solve a problem, make a decision, or communicate an idea, try one of these mental models. If you practice several of these models, you'll be well-equipped for your next big design challenge.
























Inversion: The Crucial Thinking Skill Nobody Ever Taught You
written by James Clear
Mental Models
The ancient Stoic philosophers like Marcus Aurelius, Seneca, and Epictetus regularly conducted an exercise known as a premeditatio malorum, which translates to a “premeditation of evils.”

The goal of this exercise was to envision the negative things that could happen in life. For example, the Stoics would imagine what it would be like to lose their job and become homeless or to suffer an injury and become paralyzed or to have their reputation ruined and lose their status in society.

The Stoics believed that by imagining the worst case scenario ahead of time, they could overcome their fears of negative experiences and make better plans to prevent them. While most people were focused on how they could achieve success, the Stoics also considered how they would manage failure. What would things look like if everything went wrong tomorrow? And what does this tell us about how we should prepare today?

This way of thinking, in which you consider the opposite of what you want, is known as inversion. When I first learned of it, I didn’t realize how powerful it could be. As I have studied it more, I have begun to realize that inversion is a rare and crucial skill that nearly all great thinkers use to their advantage.



How Great Thinkers Shatter the Status Quo with Inversion
The German mathematician Carl Jacobi made a number of important contributions to different scientific fields during his career. In particular, he was known for his ability to solve hard problems by following a strategy of man muss immer umkehren or, loosely translated, “invert, always invert.”

Jacobi believed that one of the best ways to clarify your thinking was to restate math problems in inverse form. He would write down the opposite of the problem he was trying to solve and found that the solution often came to him more easily.

Inversion is a powerful thinking tool because it puts a spotlight on errors and roadblocks that are not obvious at first glance. What if the opposite was true? What if I focused on a different side of this situation? Instead of asking how to do something, ask how to not do it.

Great thinkers, icons, and innovators think forward and backward. Occasionally, they drive their brain in reverse.
Great thinkers, icons, and innovators think forward and backward. They consider the opposite side of things. Occasionally, they drive their brain in reverse. This way of thinking can reveal compelling opportunities for innovation.

Art provides a good example.

One of the biggest musical shifts in the last several decades came from Nirvana, a band that legitimized a whole new genre of music—alternative rock—and whose Nevermind album is memorialized in the Library of Congress as one of the most “culturally, historically or aesthetically important” sound recordings of the 20th century.

Nirvana turned the conventions of mainstream rock and pop music completely upside down. Where hair metal bands like Poison and Def Leppard spent millions to produce and promote each record, Nirvana recorded Nevermind for $65,000. Where hair metal was flashy, Nirvana was stripped-down and raw.

Inversion is often at the core of great art. At any given time there is a status quo in society and the artists and innovators who stand out are often the ones who overturn the standard in a compelling way.

Great art breaks the previous rules. It is an inversion of what came before. In a way, the secret to unconventional thinking is just inverting the status quo.

This strategy works equally well for other creative pursuits like writing. Many great headlines and titles use the power of inversion to up-end common assumptions. As a personal example, two of my more popular articles, “Forget About Setting Goals” and “Motivation is Overvalued”, take common notions and turn them on their head.

Success is Overvalued. Avoiding Failure Matters More.
This type of inverse logic can be extended to many areas of life. For example, ambitious young people are often focused on how to achieve success. But billionaire investor Charlie Munger encourages them to consider the inverse of success instead.

“What do you want to avoid?” he asks. “Such an easy answer: sloth and unreliability. If you’re unreliable it doesn’t matter what your virtues are. You’re going to crater immediately. Doing what you have faithfully engaged to do should be an automatic part of your conduct. You want to avoid sloth and unreliability.”

Avoiding mistakes is an under-appreciated way to improve. In most jobs, you can enjoy some degree of success simply by being proactive and reliable—even if you are not particularly smart, fast, or talented in a given area. Sometimes it is more important to consider why people fail in life than why they succeed.

The Benefits of Thinking Forward and Backward
Inversion can be particularly useful in the workplace.

Leaders can ask themselves, “What would someone do each day if they were a terrible manager?” Good leaders would likely avoid those things.

Similarly, if innovation is a core piece of your business model you can ask, “How could we make this company less innovative?” Eliminating those barriers and obstacles might help creative ideas arise more quickly.

And every marketing department wants to attract new business, but it might be useful to ask, “What would alienate our core customer?” A different point of view can reveal surprising insights.

You can learn just as much from identifying what doesn’t work as you can from spotting what does. What are the mistakes, errors, and flubs that you want to avoid? Inversion is not about finding good advice, but rather about finding anti-advice. It teaches you what to avoid.

Here are some more ways to utilize inversion in work and life:

Project Management

One of my favorite applications of inversion is known as a Failure Premortem. It is like a Premeditation of Evils for the modern day company.

It works like this:

Imagine the most important goal or project you are working on right now. Now fast forward six months and assume the project or goal has failed.

Tell the story of how it happened. What went wrong? What mistakes did you make? How did it fail? In other words, think of your main goal and ask yourself, “What could cause this to go horribly wrong?”

This strategy is sometimes called the “kill the company” exercise in organizations because the goal is to spell out the exact ways the company could fail. Just like a Premeditation of Evils, the idea is to identify challenges and points of failure so you can develop a plan to prevent them ahead of time.

Productivity

Most people want to get more done in less time. Applying inversion to productivity you could ask, “What if I wanted to decrease my focus? How do I end up distracted?” The answer to that question may help you discover interruptions you can eliminate to free up more time and energy each day.

This strategy is not only effective, but often safer than chasing success. For example, some people take drugs or mental stimulants in an effort to increase their productivity. These methods might work, but you also run the risk of possible side effects.

Meanwhile, there is very little danger in leaving your phone in another room, blocking social media websites, or unplugging your television. Both strategies deal with the same problem, but inversion allows you to attack it from a different angle and with less risk.

This insight reveals a more general principle: Blindly chasing success can have severe consequences, but preventing failure usually carries very little risk.

Decluttering

Marie Kondo, author of the blockbuster best-seller The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up, uses inversion to help people declutter their homes. Her famous line is, “We should be choosing what we want to keep, not what we want to get rid of.”

In other words, the default should be to give anything away that does not “spark joy” in your life. This shift in mindset inverts decluttering by focusing on what you want to keep rather than what you want to discard.

Relationships

What behaviors might ruin a marriage? Lack of trust. Not respecting the other person. Not letting each person have time to be an individual. Spending all of your time on your kids and not investing in your relationship together. Not having open communication about money and spending habits. Inverting a good marriage can show you how to avoid a bad one.

Personal Finance

Everyone wants to make more money. But what if you inverted the problem? How could you destroy your financial health?

Spending more than you earn is a proven path to financial failure. It doesn’t matter how much money you have, the math will never work out for you over time. Similarly, accumulating debt is a hair-on-fire emergency to be resolved as quickly as possible. And gradually creeping into unchecked shopping and spending habits can lead to self-inflicted financial stress.

Before you worry too much about how to make more money make sure you have figured out how to not lose money. If you can manage to avoid these problems, you’ll be far ahead of many folks and save yourself a lot of pain and anguish along the way.

Consider the Opposite
Inversion is counterintuitive. It is not obvious to spend time thinking about the opposite of what you want.

And yet inversion is a key tool of many great thinkers. Stoic practitioners visualize negative outcomes. Groundbreaking artists invert the status quo. Effective leaders avoid the mistakes that prevent success just as much as they chase the skills that accelerate it.

Inversion can be particularly useful for challenging your own beliefs. It forces you to treat your decisions like a court of law. In court, the jury has to listen to both sides of the argument before making up their mind. Inversion helps you do something similar. What if the evidence disconfirmed what you believe? What if you tried to destroy the views that you cherish? Inversion prevents you from making up your mind after your first conclusion. It is a way to counteract the gravitational pull of confirmation bias.

Inversion is an essential skill for leading a logical and rational life. It allows you to step outside your normal patterns of thought and see situations from a different angle. Whatever problem you are facing, always consider the opposite side of things.
