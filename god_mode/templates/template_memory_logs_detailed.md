### Initial Project Setup with God Mode

Set up the initial project structure with the following components:
- Created core directory structure with `app/`, `god_mode/`, and `.cursor/` directories
- Implemented memory system with `MEMORY_CURSOR.md` for tracking architectural decisions
- Established logging system with summary and detailed logs
- Created templates for common file types
- Added automation scripts for project maintenance

The setup follows best practices for AI-assisted development, ensuring that:
- The AI has access to persistent context across sessions
- All changes are properly documented
- Standard file structures are maintained
- Development workflows are optimized

### Project Structure Documentation

Implemented project structure documentation that:
- Maps all directories and files in the project
- Provides descriptions of each component
- Serves as a navigation guide for both users and AI
- Will be automatically updated as the project evolves

The documentation is maintained in `god_mode/memory/memory_project_structure.md` and is kept up-to-date by the `script_update_project_structure.py` script.
