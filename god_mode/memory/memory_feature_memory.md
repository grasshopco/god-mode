## Detailed Changes

### [2025-03-04 14:53:12] Memory System Fix

#### Files Changed

- `god_mode/scripts/script_enhance_message_content.py`:
  - Fixed indentation error in the enhance_message function
  - Ran the audit function to repair memory files with empty content

- `god_mode/scripts/script_cursor_watch.py`:
  - Restarted the cursor watch service to properly capture messages

#### Implementation Details

We identified several issues with the God Mode memory system:

1. The message router was failing to properly process tagged content due to a "too many values to unpack" error
2. Many memory files contained only timestamp metadata without meaningful content
3. The cursor_watch script was not running, meaning messages weren't being captured for routing
4. There was an indentation error in the enhance_message function preventing the audit function from working

Our solution involved:
- Fixing the indentation error in script_enhance_message_content.py
- Running the audit function to enhance empty memory file content
- Restarting the cursor_watch service

#### Next Steps

- Implement proper error handling in the message router
- Add automated tests to verify the memory system is working
- Set up monitoring to detect when cursor_watch stops running
- Create a backup system for memory files
