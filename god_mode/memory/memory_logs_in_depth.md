### Approach

- Created a hierarchical file structure with the core `.cursorrules` file at the root level
- Established specialized notepad files for different concerns (UI, architecture, patterns)
- Ensured consistency between files with cross-references
- Set up the foundational pillars for God Mode: rules, memory, and specialized context

### Reasoning

- This setup follows best practices identified in Cursor research
- The combination of rules, memory, and specialized notepads provides a robust foundation for AI context awareness

- The structure is designed to be expandable as the project grows

## [2025-03-03 00:16:00] Created Logging System

### Files Created

- `all_logs.md`:
  - Established a master log file for tracking all AI changes in summarized format
  - Set up a clear structure with timestamps, titles, and brief descriptions
  - Included the initial setup entries
  - Purpose: Provide a quick overview of all AI activities
  
- `in_depth_logs.md`:
  - Created a detailed logging system for comprehensive documentation
  - Structured with timestamps, affected files, detailed explanations, and reasoning
  - Included detailed explanations of the initial setup process
  - Purpose: Maintain detailed records of changes, including reasoning and context

### Approach

- Implemented a two-level logging system:
  - High-level summary in `all_logs.md` for quick reference
  - Detailed explanations in `in_depth_logs.md` for comprehensive documentation
- Used consistent formatting with timestamps, headings, and structured sections
- Ensured clear cross-referencing between the logs

### Reasoning

- The dual-logging approach balances quick overview needs with detailed documentation
- Timestamped entries enable chronological tracking of changes
- Structured sections make it easy to understand the what, why, and how of each change
- Detailed reasoning helps maintain context for future development

## [2025-03-03 00:16:30] Created Feature Log System

### Files Created

- `logs/` directory:
  - Created a dedicated directory for feature-specific logs
  - Purpose: Organize feature logs in a clean and scalable way

- `logs/feature_log_template.md`:
  - Created a comprehensive template for feature-specific logs
  - Included sections for summarized changes, detailed changes, and feature overview
  - Added placeholders and examples for proper usage
  - Purpose: Provide a consistent structure for tracking feature development

### Files Modified

- `.cursorrules`:
  - Added instructions for feature log maintenance
  - Specified when and how to create or update feature logs
  - Purpose: Ensure consistent logging practices for features

### Approach

- Designed a third logging level focused on feature-specific changes
- Created a clear template that can be copied and adapted for each feature
- Updated rules to incorporate feature logging into the workflow
- Set up a directory structure that scales with the number of features

### Reasoning

- Feature-specific logs provide focused context when working on a particular feature
- The template ensures consistent documentation across features
- Separating logs by feature makes it easier to understand the evolution of specific functionality
- The three-tiered logging system (summary, detailed, feature-specific) provides appropriate granularity for different needs

## [2025-03-03 00:17:00] Set Up Learning System

### Files Created

- `learnings.md`:
  - Established a dedicated file for tracking lessons learned during development
  - Created sections for different areas of learning (general, architecture, development practices, etc.)
  - Included initial entries based on setup experience
  - Purpose: Build a knowledge repository that improves future work

### Approach

- Created a structured document with categorized sections for different types of learnings
- Included initial entries demonstrating the format and content
- Left placeholder sections for future categories
- Set up a consistent format with timestamps and clear headings

### Reasoning

- A learnings repository helps avoid repeating mistakes
- Categorized sections make it easier to find relevant insights
- The format encourages continuous documentation of new discoveries
- This document complements the memory system by focusing specifically on insights and lessons

## [2025-03-03 00:17:20] Created Project Structure Documentation

### Files Created

- `project_structure.md`:
  - Created a comprehensive map of the entire Grasshop codebase
  - Documented directories and key files with descriptions
  - Organized by major project areas
  - Purpose: Provide a guide for navigating the project structure

### Approach

- Analyzed the existing project structure using the list_dir command
- Organized documentation hierarchically, starting with the root directory
- Grouped related directories and files
- Included both AI support files and core project files
- Added placeholders for areas to be detailed as development progresses

### Reasoning

- A clear project map helps both human and AI understand the codebase organization
- Directory and file descriptions provide context about their purpose
- This document serves as a reference for finding the right files
- The structure will help prevent file duplication and ensure proper organization

## [2024-03-03 00:18:00] Implemented Context Routing Rules

### Files Created

- `.cursor/rules/frontend_rules.mdc`:
  - Created rules specifically for frontend files
  - Included UI development context, React/Next.js best practices, performance guidelines, accessibility, CSS/styling, component documentation, and change guidelines
  - Set up glob patterns to match frontend files
  - Purpose: Automatically inject relevant context when working on frontend code

- `.cursor/rules/backend_rules.mdc`:
  - Created rules specifically for backend files
  - Included architecture context, API design, database access, authentication, error handling, performance, security, and AI integration guidelines
  - Set up glob patterns to match backend files

### Approach

- Created a directory structure for Cursor rules
- Implemented three specialized rule files for different code types
- Set up glob patterns to match files by name and location
- Included comprehensive guidelines and references to notepads
- Structured rules to be clear and actionable

### Reasoning

- Directory-specific rules enable automatic context injection based on file type
- This reduces the need to manually reference documentation
- Specialized rules provide more relevant guidance than generic rules
- The automatic context makes it easier to maintain consistency across the codebase
- This approach leverages Cursor's context routing capabilities for maximum efficiency
