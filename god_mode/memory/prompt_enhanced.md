# Enhanced Prompts History

## Current Enhanced Prompt

*Last Updated: 2025-03-04 17:56:10*

The user wants to implement a fully automated God Mode system that:

1. Uses XML-style tags exclusively (<TAG>content</TAG>) in all responses
2. Processes these tags to route content to appropriate memory files
3. Enhances user prompts with context and improves them over time
4. Tracks roadmap progress and updates tasks automatically
5. Runs scripts before and after responses (prepare_response.sh and auto_commit.sh)
6. Creates a self-improving system that maintains its own documentation

The enhanced workflow should be:
- Before responding: Run script_prepare_response.sh
- When responding: Use XML-style tags for all content
- After responding: Run script_auto_commit.sh to process tags
- Regularly: Update roadmap with progress and new tasks

Focus on fixing indentation errors in script_enhance_message_content.py and adding XML tag processing to the message router.
