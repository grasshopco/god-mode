Implemented a routing tracker to show which content was saved where. It records the tag type, content snippet, destination file, and line number for each routing operation. The system provides clickable links to open files at exact content locations and maintains a history of recent routing operations.
it's odd. option "r" is saying it can't find the routing but the option where i check the logs is saying that it is successfuly routing.

also you just did "FEATURE_LOG: RouterTracker" but i don't see which specific feature file that is getting sent to because we have a file called "memory_log_feature_featurename.md" but clearly we have not set stuff up to check if a file for a feature exists or not and to create or route to it accordingly

Thought Process
You're right about both issues! Let's fix them:
1. Routing History Not Being Tracked
The issue is that while content is successfully being routed to files (as you can see in the logs), the tracking history isn't being saved properly. Looking at the code, I can see two problems:
The import in script_message_router.py is trying to import directly, but it needs the full path
We need to ensure the .cache directory exists
Let's fix this:
The file has been partially updated, but we need to fix it more comprehensively:
False
Let's check if there are issues with the script_track_routing.py file:
Let's try a different approach by creating a complete replacement for the process_feature_log function and append_to_file function:
Now let's create a test script that can initialize the routing history:
)
Now let's make the initialization script executable and run it:
Now let's update the append_to_file function so it explicitly tracks all routing events:
Now let's run a test to see if our routing tracking is working:
Let's now route this content and check if everything works:
Let's fix the feature logs path in process_feature_log:
Now let's also fix the directory_exists and file_exists functions to be consistent:
Now let's try to run the route script directly:
There's an error in our module imports. Let's fix that:
Perfect! Now let's try routing our content again:
The route script can't find any markers in the clipboard content. Let's check what's in the clipboard:
It looks like our clipboard content got replaced. Let's try again with new content:
Now let's try routing again:
There seems to be an issue with the multi-tag regex pattern. Let's enable debug mode to see what's happening:
It looks like something is changing the clipboard content. Let's try one more time and then immediately check:
Let's look at the regex patterns in the message router script to see what's going on:
Let's look for the multi-tag regex pattern:
Let's look at how the multi-tag pattern matching is implemented in the message router:
Let's see how it handles the multi-tag in the code:
Let's see more of this code section:
Let's look at the debugging code to see what's happening with FEATURE_LOG processing:
Let's see the rest of the process_feature_log function:
Let's run the route script with debug mode enabled to see what's happening:
Great! The routing is actually working correctly. Let's check the files that were created:
Let's check the correct path:
Great! The file memory_log_feature_routertracker.md was created. Let's check its contents:
Let's also check the LOG_SUMMARY file:
Great! The routing system is working correctly. Let's summarize what we found:
The MULTI_TAG pattern is correctly defined in the script as: MULTI_TAG_PATTERN = r"\
