## Requirements Acceptance Criteria

The following acceptance criteria have been defined for Requirements:

1. **Given** a user with valid credentials
   **When** they attempt to access protected resources
   **Then** they should be granted access based on their permission level

2. **Given** a system under peak load
   **When** 1000+ concurrent requests are made
   **Then** response time should remain under 500ms

3. **Given** a user performing a data-intensive operation
   **When** the operation exceeds 10 seconds
   **Then** the system should provide progress updates

These criteria will be used for verification and validation during testing.

## Requirements Requirements Update

New requirements have been identified for the Requirements component:

### Functional Requirements
1. **User Authentication**: System must support OAuth 2.0 and social login options
2. **Data Export**: Users must be able to export data in CSV and JSON formats
3. **Notifications**: System must provide real-time notifications for important events

### Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Performance**: API responses must be under 200ms for 95% of requests

## Requirements Acceptance Criteria

The following acceptance criteria have been defined for Requirements:

1. **Given** a user with valid credentials
   **When** they attempt to access protected resources
   **Then** they should be granted access based on their permission level

2. **Given** a system under peak load
   **When** 1000+ concurrent requests are made
   **Then** response time should remain under 500ms

3. **Given** a user performing a data-intensive operation
   **When** the operation exceeds 10 seconds
   **Then** the system should provide progress updates

These criteria will be used for verification and validation during testing.
