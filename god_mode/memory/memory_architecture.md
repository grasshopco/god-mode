## Architecture Architecture Decision

After careful analysis, we've decided to implement Architecture using a layered architecture for the following reasons:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer has a specific responsibility
2. **Testability**: Components can be tested in isolation
3. **Maintainability**: Changes in one layer don't affect others
4. **Reusability**: Common functionality can be extracted into shared layers

The architecture consists of:
- Presentation Layer: User interfaces and views
- Business Logic Layer: Domain models and business rules
- Data Access Layer: Storage and retrieval logic
- Infrastructure Layer: Technical capabilities and cross-cutting concerns

This architecture aligns with our overall system design principles.


## Architecture Component Structure

The Architecture component has been structured using a microservices approach:

```
├── api-gateway/
│   ├── routing.js
│   └── authentication.js
├── services/
│   ├── service-a/
│   │   ├── index.js
│   │   └── database.js
│   └── service-b/
│       ├── index.js
│       └── database.js
├── shared/
│   ├── models/
│   ├── utilities/
│   └── constants.js
└── docker-compose.yml
```

Each service is independently deployable and maintainable, communicating through well-defined APIs.

## Architecture Architecture Decision

After careful analysis, we've decided to implement Architecture using a layered architecture for the following reasons:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer has a specific responsibility
2. **Testability**: Components can be tested in isolation
3. **Maintainability**: Changes in one layer don't affect others
4. **Reusability**: Common functionality can be extracted into shared layers

The architecture consists of:
- Presentation Layer: User interfaces and views
- Business Logic Layer: Domain models and business rules
- Data Access Layer: Storage and retrieval logic
- Infrastructure Layer: Technical capabilities and cross-cutting concerns

This architecture aligns with our overall system design principles.

Filename format: 20250304_060741
Log format: 2025-03-04 06:07:41 UTC

The project now uses a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns.
Each module follows the repository pattern with standard naming conventions.
```

This will route the content to:
- MEMORY_CURSOR.md
- memory_architecture.md
- memory_conventions.md

### Example 2: Route to Logs and Features

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer has a specific responsibility
2. **Testability**: Components can be tested in isolation
3. **Maintainability**: Changes in one layer don't affect others
4. **Reusability**: Common functionality can be extracted into shared layers

The architecture consists of:
- Presentation Layer: User interfaces and views
- Business Logic Layer: Domain models and business rules
- Data Access Layer: Storage and retrieval logic
- Infrastructure Layer: Technical capabilities and cross-cutting concerns

This architecture aligns with our overall system design principles.

## Architecture Architecture Decision

After careful analysis, we've decided to implement Architecture using a layered architecture for the following reasons:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer has a specific responsibility
2. **Testability**: Components can be tested in isolation
3. **Maintainability**: Changes in one layer don't affect others
4. **Reusability**: Common functionality can be extracted into shared layers

The architecture consists of:
- Presentation Layer: User interfaces and views
- Business Logic Layer: Domain models and business rules
- Data Access Layer: Storage and retrieval logic
- Infrastructure Layer: Technical capabilities and cross-cutting concerns

This architecture aligns with our overall system design principles.

## Architecture Component Structure

The Architecture component has been structured using a microservices approach:

```
├── api-gateway/
│   ├── routing.js
│   └── authentication.js
├── services/
│   ├── service-a/
│   │   ├── index.js
│   │   └── database.js

│       └── database.js
├── shared/
│   ├── models/
│   ├── utilities/
│   └── constants.js
└── docker-compose.yml
```

Each service is independently deployable and maintainable, communicating through well-defined APIs.


## Architecture Architecture Decision

After careful analysis, we've decided to implement Architecture using a layered architecture for the following reasons:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer has a specific responsibility
2. **Testability**: Components can be tested in isolation
3. **Maintainability**: Changes in one layer don't affect others
4. **Reusability**: Common functionality can be extracted into shared layers

The architecture consists of:
- Presentation Layer: User interfaces and views
- Business Logic Layer: Domain models and business rules
- Data Access Layer: Storage and retrieval logic
- Infrastructure Layer: Technical capabilities and cross-cutting concerns

This architecture aligns with our overall system design principles.

## Architecture Architecture Decision

After careful analysis, we've decided to implement Architecture using a layered architecture for the following reasons:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer has a specific responsibility
2. **Testability**: Components can be tested in isolation
3. **Maintainability**: Changes in one layer don't affect others
4. **Reusability**: Common functionality can be extracted into shared layers

The architecture consists of:
- Presentation Layer: User interfaces and views
- Business Logic Layer: Domain models and business rules
- Data Access Layer: Storage and retrieval logic
- Infrastructure Layer: Technical capabilities and cross-cutting concerns

This architecture aligns with our overall system design principles.

## Architecture Component Structure

The Architecture component has been structured using a microservices approach:

```
├── api-gateway/
│   ├── routing.js
│   └── authentication.js
├── services/
│   ├── service-a/
│   │   ├── index.js
│   │   └── database.js
│   └── service-b/
│       ├── index.js
│       └── database.js
├── shared/
│   ├── models/
│   ├── utilities/
│   └── constants.js
└── docker-compose.yml
```

Each service is independently deployable and maintainable, communicating through well-defined APIs.


## Architecture Architecture Decision

After careful analysis, we've decided to implement Architecture using a layered architecture for the following reasons:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer has a specific responsibility
2. **Testability**: Components can be tested in isolation
3. **Maintainability**: Changes in one layer don't affect others
4. **Reusability**: Common functionality can be extracted into shared layers

The architecture consists of:
- Presentation Layer: User interfaces and views
- Business Logic Layer: Domain models and business rules
- Data Access Layer: Storage and retrieval logic
- Infrastructure Layer: Technical capabilities and cross-cutting concerns

This architecture aligns with our overall system design principles.

## Architecture Architecture Decision

After careful analysis, we've decided to implement Architecture using a layered architecture for the following reasons:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer has a specific responsibility
2. **Testability**: Components can be tested in isolation
3. **Maintainability**: Changes in one layer don't affect others
4. **Reusability**: Common functionality can be extracted into shared layers

The architecture consists of:
- Presentation Layer: User interfaces and views
- Business Logic Layer: Domain models and business rules
- Data Access Layer: Storage and retrieval logic
- Infrastructure Layer: Technical capabilities and cross-cutting concerns

This architecture aligns with our overall system design principles.

## Architecture Component Structure

The Architecture component has been structured using a microservices approach:

```
├── api-gateway/
│   ├── routing.js
│   └── authentication.js
├── services/
│   ├── service-a/
│   │   ├── index.js
│   │   └── database.js

```

Each service is independently deployable and maintainable, communicating through well-defined APIs.


## Architecture Architecture Decision

After careful analysis, we've decided to implement Architecture using a layered architecture for the following reasons:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer has a specific responsibility
2. **Testability**: Components can be tested in isolation
3. **Maintainability**: Changes in one layer don't affect others
4. **Reusability**: Common functionality can be extracted into shared layers

The architecture consists of:
- Presentation Layer: User interfaces and views
- Business Logic Layer: Domain models and business rules
- Data Access Layer: Storage and retrieval logic
- Infrastructure Layer: Technical capabilities and cross-cutting concerns

This architecture aligns with our overall system design principles.

## Architecture Architecture Decision

After careful analysis, we've decided to implement Architecture using a layered architecture for the following reasons:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer has a specific responsibility
2. **Testability**: Components can be tested in isolation
3. **Maintainability**: Changes in one layer don't affect others
4. **Reusability**: Common functionality can be extracted into shared layers

The architecture consists of:
- Presentation Layer: User interfaces and views
- Business Logic Layer: Domain models and business rules
- Data Access Layer: Storage and retrieval logic
- Infrastructure Layer: Technical capabilities and cross-cutting concerns

This architecture aligns with our overall system design principles.

## Architecture Architecture Decision

After careful analysis, we've decided to implement Architecture using a layered architecture for the following reasons:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer has a specific responsibility
2. **Testability**: Components can be tested in isolation
3. **Maintainability**: Changes in one layer don't affect others
4. **Reusability**: Common functionality can be extracted into shared layers

The architecture consists of:
- Presentation Layer: User interfaces and views
- Business Logic Layer: Domain models and business rules
- Data Access Layer: Storage and retrieval logic
- Infrastructure Layer: Technical capabilities and cross-cutting concerns

This architecture aligns with our overall system design principles.

The Architecture component has been structured using a microservices approach:

```
├── api-gateway/
│   ├── routing.js
│   └── authentication.js
├── services/
│   ├── service-a/
│   │   ├── index.js
│   │   └── database.js
│   └── service-b/
│       ├── index.js
│       └── database.js
├── shared/
│   ├── models/
│   ├── utilities/
│   └── constants.js
└── docker-compose.yml
```

Each service is independently deployable and maintainable, communicating through well-defined APIs.


## Architecture Architecture Decision

After careful analysis, we've decided to implement Architecture using a layered architecture for the following reasons:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer has a specific responsibility
2. **Testability**: Components can be tested in isolation
3. **Maintainability**: Changes in one layer don't affect others
4. **Reusability**: Common functionality can be extracted into shared layers

The architecture consists of:
- Presentation Layer: User interfaces and views
- Business Logic Layer: Domain models and business rules
- Data Access Layer: Storage and retrieval logic
- Infrastructure Layer: Technical capabilities and cross-cutting concerns

This architecture aligns with our overall system design principles.

## Architecture Architecture Decision

After careful analysis, we've decided to implement Architecture using a layered architecture for the following reasons:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer has a specific responsibility
2. **Testability**: Components can be tested in isolation
3. **Maintainability**: Changes in one layer don't affect others
4. **Reusability**: Common functionality can be extracted into shared layers

The architecture consists of:
- Presentation Layer: User interfaces and views
- Business Logic Layer: Domain models and business rules
- Data Access Layer: Storage and retrieval logic
- Infrastructure Layer: Technical capabilities and cross-cutting concerns

This architecture aligns with our overall system design principles.

```

Each service is independently deployable and maintainable, communicating through well-defined APIs.


## Architecture Architecture Decision

After careful analysis, we've decided to implement Architecture using a layered architecture for the following reasons:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer has a specific responsibility
2. **Testability**: Components can be tested in isolation
3. **Maintainability**: Changes in one layer don't affect others
4. **Reusability**: Common functionality can be extracted into shared layers

The architecture consists of:
- Presentation Layer: User interfaces and views
- Business Logic Layer: Domain models and business rules
- Data Access Layer: Storage and retrieval logic
- Infrastructure Layer: Technical capabilities and cross-cutting concerns

This architecture aligns with our overall system design principles.

## Architecture Architecture Decision

After careful analysis, we've decided to implement Architecture using a layered architecture for the following reasons:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer has a specific responsibility
2. **Testability**: Components can be tested in isolation
3. **Maintainability**: Changes in one layer don't affect others
4. **Reusability**: Common functionality can be extracted into shared layers

The architecture consists of:
- Presentation Layer: User interfaces and views
- Business Logic Layer: Domain models and business rules
- Data Access Layer: Storage and retrieval logic
- Infrastructure Layer: Technical capabilities and cross-cutting concerns

This architecture aligns with our overall system design principles.

## Architecture Architecture Decision

After careful analysis, we've decided to implement Architecture using a layered architecture for the following reasons:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer has a specific responsibility
2. **Testability**: Components can be tested in isolation
3. **Maintainability**: Changes in one layer don't affect others
4. **Reusability**: Common functionality can be extracted into shared layers

The architecture consists of:
- Presentation Layer: User interfaces and views
- Business Logic Layer: Domain models and business rules
- Data Access Layer: Storage and retrieval logic
- Infrastructure Layer: Technical capabilities and cross-cutting concerns

This architecture aligns with our overall system design principles.

## Architecture Component Structure

The Architecture component has been structured using a microservices approach:

```
├── api-gateway/
│   ├── routing.js
│   └── authentication.js
├── services/
│   ├── service-a/
│   │   ├── index.js
│   │   └── database.js
│   └── service-b/
│       ├── index.js
│       └── database.js
├── shared/
│   ├── models/
│   ├── utilities/
│   └── constants.js
└── docker-compose.yml
```

Each service is independently deployable and maintainable, communicating through well-defined APIs.


## Architecture Architecture Decision

After careful analysis, we've decided to implement Architecture using a layered architecture for the following reasons:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer has a specific responsibility
2. **Testability**: Components can be tested in isolation
3. **Maintainability**: Changes in one layer don't affect others
4. **Reusability**: Common functionality can be extracted into shared layers

The architecture consists of:
- Presentation Layer: User interfaces and views
- Business Logic Layer: Domain models and business rules
- Data Access Layer: Storage and retrieval logic
- Infrastructure Layer: Technical capabilities and cross-cutting concerns

This architecture aligns with our overall system design principles.

## Architecture Architecture Decision

After careful analysis, we've decided to implement Architecture using a layered architecture for the following reasons:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer has a specific responsibility
2. **Testability**: Components can be tested in isolation
3. **Maintainability**: Changes in one layer don't affect others
4. **Reusability**: Common functionality can be extracted into shared layers

The architecture consists of:
- Presentation Layer: User interfaces and views
- Business Logic Layer: Domain models and business rules
- Data Access Layer: Storage and retrieval logic
- Infrastructure Layer: Technical capabilities and cross-cutting concerns

This architecture aligns with our overall system design principles.

## Architecture Component Structure

The Architecture component has been structured using a microservices approach:

```
├── api-gateway/
│   ├── routing.js
│   └── authentication.js
├── services/
│   ├── service-a/
│   │   ├── index.js
│   │   └── database.js
│   └── service-b/
│       ├── index.js
│       └── database.js
├── shared/
│   ├── models/
│   ├── utilities/
│   └── constants.js
└── docker-compose.yml
```

Each service is independently deployable and maintainable, communicating through well-defined APIs.


## Architecture Architecture Decision

After careful analysis, we've decided to implement Architecture using a layered architecture for the following reasons:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer has a specific responsibility
2. **Testability**: Components can be tested in isolation
3. **Maintainability**: Changes in one layer don't affect others
4. **Reusability**: Common functionality can be extracted into shared layers

The architecture consists of:
- Presentation Layer: User interfaces and views
- Business Logic Layer: Domain models and business rules
- Data Access Layer: Storage and retrieval logic
- Infrastructure Layer: Technical capabilities and cross-cutting concerns

This architecture aligns with our overall system design principles.

This architecture aligns with our overall system design principles.


## Architecture Architecture Decision

After careful analysis, we've decided to implement Architecture using a layered architecture for the following reasons:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer has a specific responsibility
2. **Testability**: Components can be tested in isolation
3. **Maintainability**: Changes in one layer don't affect others
4. **Reusability**: Common functionality can be extracted into shared layers

## Architecture Architecture Decision

After careful analysis, we've decided to implement Architecture using a layered architecture for the following reasons:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer has a specific responsibility
2. **Testability**: Components can be tested in isolation
3. **Maintainability**: Changes in one layer don't affect others
4. **Reusability**: Common functionality can be extracted into shared layers

The architecture consists of:
- Presentation Layer: User interfaces and views
- Business Logic Layer: Domain models and business rules
- Data Access Layer: Storage and retrieval logic
- Infrastructure Layer: Technical capabilities and cross-cutting concerns

This architecture aligns with our overall system design principles.

## Architecture Architecture Decision

After careful analysis, we've decided to implement Architecture using a layered architecture for the following reasons:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer has a specific responsibility
2. **Testability**: Components can be tested in isolation
3. **Maintainability**: Changes in one layer don't affect others
4. **Reusability**: Common functionality can be extracted into shared layers

The architecture consists of:
- Presentation Layer: User interfaces and views
- Business Logic Layer: Domain models and business rules
- Data Access Layer: Storage and retrieval logic
- Infrastructure Layer: Technical capabilities and cross-cutting concerns

This architecture aligns with our overall system design principles.

## Architecture Component Structure

The Architecture component has been structured using a microservices approach:

```
├── api-gateway/
│   ├── routing.js
│   └── authentication.js
├── services/
│   ├── service-a/
│   │   ├── index.js
│   │   └── database.js
│   └── service-b/
│       ├── index.js
│       └── database.js
├── shared/
│   ├── models/
│   ├── utilities/
│   └── constants.js
└── docker-compose.yml
```

Each service is independently deployable and maintainable, communicating through well-defined APIs.

Each service is independently deployable and maintainable, communicating through well-defined APIs.


## Architecture Architecture Decision

After careful analysis, we've decided to implement Architecture using a layered architecture for the following reasons:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer has a specific responsibility
2. **Testability**: Components can be tested in isolation
3. **Maintainability**: Changes in one layer don't affect others
4. **Reusability**: Common functionality can be extracted into shared layers

The architecture consists of:
- Presentation Layer: User interfaces and views
- Business Logic Layer: Domain models and business rules
- Data Access Layer: Storage and retrieval logic
- Infrastructure Layer: Technical capabilities and cross-cutting concerns

This architecture aligns with our overall system design principles.

## Architecture Architecture Decision

After careful analysis, we've decided to implement Architecture using a layered architecture for the following reasons:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer has a specific responsibility
2. **Testability**: Components can be tested in isolation
3. **Maintainability**: Changes in one layer don't affect others
4. **Reusability**: Common functionality can be extracted into shared layers

The architecture consists of:
- Presentation Layer: User interfaces and views
- Business Logic Layer: Domain models and business rules
- Data Access Layer: Storage and retrieval logic
- Infrastructure Layer: Technical capabilities and cross-cutting concerns

This architecture aligns with our overall system design principles.

## Architecture Component Structure

The Architecture component has been structured using a microservices approach:

```
├── api-gateway/
│   ├── routing.js
│   └── authentication.js
├── services/
│   ├── service-a/
│   │   ├── index.js
│   │   └── database.js
│   └── service-b/
│       ├── index.js
│       └── database.js
├── shared/
│   ├── models/
│   ├── utilities/
│   └── constants.js
└── docker-compose.yml
```

Each service is independently deployable and maintainable, communicating through well-defined APIs.


## Architecture Architecture Decision

After careful analysis, we've decided to implement Architecture using a layered architecture for the following reasons:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer has a specific responsibility
2. **Testability**: Components can be tested in isolation
3. **Maintainability**: Changes in one layer don't affect others
4. **Reusability**: Common functionality can be extracted into shared layers

The architecture consists of:
- Presentation Layer: User interfaces and views
- Business Logic Layer: Domain models and business rules
- Data Access Layer: Storage and retrieval logic
- Infrastructure Layer: Technical capabilities and cross-cutting concerns

This architecture aligns with our overall system design principles.

## Architecture Architecture Decision

After careful analysis, we've decided to implement Architecture using a layered architecture for the following reasons:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer has a specific responsibility
2. **Testability**: Components can be tested in isolation
3. **Maintainability**: Changes in one layer don't affect others
4. **Reusability**: Common functionality can be extracted into shared layers

The architecture consists of:
- Presentation Layer: User interfaces and views
- Business Logic Layer: Domain models and business rules
- Data Access Layer: Storage and retrieval logic
- Infrastructure Layer: Technical capabilities and cross-cutting concerns

This architecture aligns with our overall system design principles.


## Architecture Component Structure

The Architecture component has been structured using a microservices approach:

```
├── api-gateway/
│   ├── routing.js
│   └── authentication.js
├── services/
│   ├── service-a/
│   │   ├── index.js
│   │   └── database.js
│   └── service-b/

│       └── database.js
├── shared/
│   ├── models/
│   ├── utilities/
│   └── constants.js
└── docker-compose.yml
```

Each service is independently deployable and maintainable, communicating through well-defined APIs.

## Architecture Architecture Decision

After careful analysis, we've decided to implement Architecture using a layered architecture for the following reasons:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer has a specific responsibility
2. **Testability**: Components can be tested in isolation
3. **Maintainability**: Changes in one layer don't affect others
4. **Reusability**: Common functionality can be extracted into shared layers

The architecture consists of:
- Presentation Layer: User interfaces and views
- Business Logic Layer: Domain models and business rules
- Data Access Layer: Storage and retrieval logic
- Infrastructure Layer: Technical capabilities and cross-cutting concerns

This architecture aligns with our overall system design principles.

## Architecture Architecture Decision

After careful analysis, we've decided to implement Architecture using a layered architecture for the following reasons:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer has a specific responsibility
2. **Testability**: Components can be tested in isolation
3. **Maintainability**: Changes in one layer don't affect others
4. **Reusability**: Common functionality can be extracted into shared layers

The architecture consists of:
- Presentation Layer: User interfaces and views
- Business Logic Layer: Domain models and business rules
- Data Access Layer: Storage and retrieval logic
- Infrastructure Layer: Technical capabilities and cross-cutting concerns

This architecture aligns with our overall system design principles.

## Architecture Architecture Decision

After careful analysis, we've decided to implement Architecture using a layered architecture for the following reasons:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer has a specific responsibility
2. **Testability**: Components can be tested in isolation
3. **Maintainability**: Changes in one layer don't affect others
4. **Reusability**: Common functionality can be extracted into shared layers

The architecture consists of:
- Presentation Layer: User interfaces and views
- Business Logic Layer: Domain models and business rules
- Data Access Layer: Storage and retrieval logic
- Infrastructure Layer: Technical capabilities and cross-cutting concerns

This architecture aligns with our overall system design principles.

## Architecture Component Structure

The Architecture component has been structured using a microservices approach:

```
├── api-gateway/
│   ├── routing.js
│   └── authentication.js
├── services/
│   ├── service-a/
│   │   ├── index.js
│   │   └── database.js

│       └── database.js
├── shared/
│   ├── models/
│   ├── utilities/
│   └── constants.js
└── docker-compose.yml
```

Each service is independently deployable and maintainable, communicating through well-defined APIs.
