Now that we have installed the basics of the UI with our theme system and shadcn as well as other stuff needed, we need to now get back to our logic. this stuff should work such that everything operates in the web-ui like i talked about. i will reiterate it here again for clarity's sake:


we now have the web UI working. well done. we need to now do some other smart things in my opinion. We probably want to make it to where I don't have to use, and I shouldn't be using, the Cursor chat input, because when I use that, then it bypasses all of our enhancement stuff. By going through the Webb, UI, like you pointed out in the Webb UI concept readme.md file, we can intercept things on the way out and on the way in. This allows us to properly process the xml tag blocks improperly sort things. Furthermore, it means that I don't have to do the GM or GMP stuff.

It should be such that I don't need to copy and paste the AI response because of the way that we are now doing this. Instead, it should be able to be automatic. So, all I have to do is worry about putting in my prompt and then I will just send it off by pressing the enhance with God mode button and then our code is automatically going to run the script to enhance it and then the AI response is going to come in and it should we need to have the scripts being run so when that response comes in it then processes, it and routes everything accordingly based off of the script being run. The user should not have to copy part of the AI response. Now, if they would like to, I suppose they could if we needed it as a fail, safe mechanism so if something doesn't happen properly, then at least they can still copy the section of the AI message and then submit it, and it will get routed to the correct memory file. but of course for the UI, this should be like a triangle alert button (triangle with "!" in it) or some small text somewhere they can Quick to pull up the input to paste the AI portion of the message and do that manually.

Now that we know the web UI interface is kind of working. We do need to actually make it start working based off what I've described to you.
Lol I literally copied this from the input in the Web UI and then pasted it into the Cursor chat and it gave the full enhanced prop so I guess that worked lol but it didn't work in the web UI obviously because in the second input in step two, it just said this was a placeholder text. l So all the stuff that I mentioned above, still applies in terms of the improvement we need to make the UI logic. 

set everything up such that it looks a lot better and easier, cleaner, and better to interact with. please continue following our future proofing file because we don't want to repeat anything ever.
