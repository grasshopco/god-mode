I've addressed several critical issues with the God Mode system:
Fixed Cursor Watch Script: Identified and fixed the indentation error in script_cursor_watch.py that was causing it to crash. The script now starts properly and monitors Cursor conversations.
Implemented Auto-Commit Functionality: Created a robust script_auto_commit.sh script that automatically commits changes to Git after each response, with proper error handling and remote repository support.
Created Response Workflow Scripts:
script_prepare_response.sh: Runs before an AI response to ensure all components are running, memory files exist, and cursor rules are updated
script_complete_response.sh: Runs after an AI response to verify tags were used and auto-commit changes
Enhanced God Mode Remote Control:
Added new menu options for preparing for responses and finalizing responses
Implemented functions to run the workflow scripts
Improved error handling and user feedback
Updated Cursor Rules:
Added explicit instructions to include

I've addressed several critical issues with the God Mode system:
Fixed Cursor Watch Script: Identified and fixed the indentation error in script_cursor_watch.py that was causing it to crash. The script now starts properly and monitors Cursor conversations.
Implemented Auto-Commit Functionality: Created a robust script_auto_commit.sh script that automatically commits changes to Git after each response, with proper error handling and remote repository support.
Created Response Workflow Scripts:
script_prepare_response.sh: Runs before an AI response to ensure all components are running, memory files exist, and cursor rules are updated
script_complete_response.sh: Runs after an AI response to verify tags were used and auto-commit changes
Enhanced God Mode Remote Control:
Added new menu options for preparing for responses and finalizing responses
Implemented functions to run the workflow scripts
Improved error handling and user feedback
Updated Cursor Rules:
Added explicit instructions to include

I've addressed several critical issues with the God Mode system:
Fixed Cursor Watch Script: Identified and fixed the indentation error in script_cursor_watch.py that was causing it to crash. The script now starts properly and monitors Cursor conversations.
Implemented Auto-Commit Functionality: Created a robust script_auto_commit.sh script that automatically commits changes to Git after each response, with proper error handling and remote repository support.
Created Response Workflow Scripts:
script_prepare_response.sh: Runs before an AI response to ensure all components are running, memory files exist, and cursor rules are updated
script_complete_response.sh: Runs after an AI response to verify tags were used and auto-commit changes
Enhanced God Mode Remote Control:
Added new menu options for preparing for responses and finalizing responses
Implemented functions to run the workflow scripts
Improved error handling and user feedback
Updated Cursor Rules:
Added explicit instructions to include

I've addressed several critical issues with the God Mode system:
Fixed Cursor Watch Script: Identified and fixed the indentation error in script_cursor_watch.py that was causing it to crash. The script now starts properly and monitors Cursor conversations.
Implemented Auto-Commit Functionality: Created a robust script_auto_commit.sh script that automatically commits changes to Git after each response, with proper error handling and remote repository support.
Created Response Workflow Scripts:
script_prepare_response.sh: Runs before an AI response to ensure all components are running, memory files exist, and cursor rules are updated
script_complete_response.sh: Runs after an AI response to verify tags were used and auto-commit changes
Enhanced God Mode Remote Control:
Added new menu options for preparing for responses and finalizing responses
Implemented functions to run the workflow scripts
Improved error handling and user feedback
Updated Cursor Rules:
Added explicit instructions to include

I've addressed several critical issues with the God Mode system:
Fixed Cursor Watch Script: Identified and fixed the indentation error in script_cursor_watch.py that was causing it to crash. The script now starts properly and monitors Cursor conversations.
Implemented Auto-Commit Functionality: Created a robust script_auto_commit.sh script that automatically commits changes to Git after each response, with proper error handling and remote repository support.
Created Response Workflow Scripts:
script_prepare_response.sh: Runs before an AI response to ensure all components are running, memory files exist, and cursor rules are updated
script_complete_response.sh: Runs after an AI response to verify tags were used and auto-commit changes
Enhanced God Mode Remote Control:
Added new menu options for preparing for responses and finalizing responses
Implemented functions to run the workflow scripts
Improved error handling and user feedback
Updated Cursor Rules:
Added explicit instructions to include

I've addressed several critical issues with the God Mode system:
Fixed Cursor Watch Script: Identified and fixed the indentation error in script_cursor_watch.py that was causing it to crash. The script now starts properly and monitors Cursor conversations.
Implemented Auto-Commit Functionality: Created a robust script_auto_commit.sh script that automatically commits changes to Git after each response, with proper error handling and remote repository support.
Created Response Workflow Scripts:
script_prepare_response.sh: Runs before an AI response to ensure all components are running, memory files exist, and cursor rules are updated
script_complete_response.sh: Runs after an AI response to verify tags were used and auto-commit changes
Enhanced God Mode Remote Control:
Added new menu options for preparing for responses and finalizing responses
Implemented functions to run the workflow scripts
Improved error handling and user feedback
Updated Cursor Rules:
Added explicit instructions to include

I've addressed several critical issues with the God Mode system:
Fixed Cursor Watch Script: Identified and fixed the indentation error in script_cursor_watch.py that was causing it to crash. The script now starts properly and monitors Cursor conversations.
Implemented Auto-Commit Functionality: Created a robust script_auto_commit.sh script that automatically commits changes to Git after each response, with proper error handling and remote repository support.
Created Response Workflow Scripts:
script_prepare_response.sh: Runs before an AI response to ensure all components are running, memory files exist, and cursor rules are updated
script_complete_response.sh: Runs after an AI response to verify tags were used and auto-commit changes
Enhanced God Mode Remote Control:
Added new menu options for preparing for responses and finalizing responses
Implemented functions to run the workflow scripts
Improved error handling and user feedback
Updated Cursor Rules:
Added explicit instructions to include

I've addressed several critical issues with the God Mode system:
Fixed Cursor Watch Script: Identified and fixed the indentation error in script_cursor_watch.py that was causing it to crash. The script now starts properly and monitors Cursor conversations.
Implemented Auto-Commit Functionality: Created a robust script_auto_commit.sh script that automatically commits changes to Git after each response, with proper error handling and remote repository support.
Created Response Workflow Scripts:
script_prepare_response.sh: Runs before an AI response to ensure all components are running, memory files exist, and cursor rules are updated
script_complete_response.sh: Runs after an AI response to verify tags were used and auto-commit changes
Enhanced God Mode Remote Control:
Added new menu options for preparing for responses and finalizing responses
Implemented functions to run the workflow scripts
Improved error handling and user feedback
Updated Cursor Rules:
Added explicit instructions to include

I've addressed several critical issues with the God Mode system:
Fixed Cursor Watch Script: Identified and fixed the indentation error in script_cursor_watch.py that was causing it to crash. The script now starts properly and monitors Cursor conversations.
Implemented Auto-Commit Functionality: Created a robust script_auto_commit.sh script that automatically commits changes to Git after each response, with proper error handling and remote repository support.
Created Response Workflow Scripts:
script_prepare_response.sh: Runs before an AI response to ensure all components are running, memory files exist, and cursor rules are updated
script_complete_response.sh: Runs after an AI response to verify tags were used and auto-commit changes
Enhanced God Mode Remote Control:
Added new menu options for preparing for responses and finalizing responses
Implemented functions to run the workflow scripts
Improved error handling and user feedback
Updated Cursor Rules:
Added explicit instructions to include

I've addressed several critical issues with the God Mode system:
Fixed Cursor Watch Script: Identified and fixed the indentation error in script_cursor_watch.py that was causing it to crash. The script now starts properly and monitors Cursor conversations.
Implemented Auto-Commit Functionality: Created a robust script_auto_commit.sh script that automatically commits changes to Git after each response, with proper error handling and remote repository support.
Created Response Workflow Scripts:
script_prepare_response.sh: Runs before an AI response to ensure all components are running, memory files exist, and cursor rules are updated
script_complete_response.sh: Runs after an AI response to verify tags were used and auto-commit changes
Enhanced God Mode Remote Control:
Added new menu options for preparing for responses and finalizing responses
Implemented functions to run the workflow scripts
Improved error handling and user feedback
Updated Cursor Rules:
Added explicit instructions to include

I've addressed several critical issues with the God Mode system:
Fixed Cursor Watch Script: Identified and fixed the indentation error in script_cursor_watch.py that was causing it to crash. The script now starts properly and monitors Cursor conversations.
Implemented Auto-Commit Functionality: Created a robust script_auto_commit.sh script that automatically commits changes to Git after each response, with proper error handling and remote repository support.
Created Response Workflow Scripts:
script_prepare_response.sh: Runs before an AI response to ensure all components are running, memory files exist, and cursor rules are updated
script_complete_response.sh: Runs after an AI response to verify tags were used and auto-commit changes
Enhanced God Mode Remote Control:
Added new menu options for preparing for responses and finalizing responses
Implemented functions to run the workflow scripts
Improved error handling and user feedback
Updated Cursor Rules:
Added explicit instructions to include

I've addressed several critical issues with the God Mode system:
Fixed Cursor Watch Script: Identified and fixed the indentation error in script_cursor_watch.py that was causing it to crash. The script now starts properly and monitors Cursor conversations.
Implemented Auto-Commit Functionality: Created a robust script_auto_commit.sh script that automatically commits changes to Git after each response, with proper error handling and remote repository support.
Created Response Workflow Scripts:
script_prepare_response.sh: Runs before an AI response to ensure all components are running, memory files exist, and cursor rules are updated
script_complete_response.sh: Runs after an AI response to verify tags were used and auto-commit changes
Enhanced God Mode Remote Control:
Added new menu options for preparing for responses and finalizing responses
Implemented functions to run the workflow scripts
Improved error handling and user feedback
Updated Cursor Rules:
Added explicit instructions to include

I've addressed several critical issues with the God Mode system:
Fixed Cursor Watch Script: Identified and fixed the indentation error in script_cursor_watch.py that was causing it to crash. The script now starts properly and monitors Cursor conversations.
Implemented Auto-Commit Functionality: Created a robust script_auto_commit.sh script that automatically commits changes to Git after each response, with proper error handling and remote repository support.
Created Response Workflow Scripts:
script_prepare_response.sh: Runs before an AI response to ensure all components are running, memory files exist, and cursor rules are updated
script_complete_response.sh: Runs after an AI response to verify tags were used and auto-commit changes
Enhanced God Mode Remote Control:
Added new menu options for preparing for responses and finalizing responses
Implemented functions to run the workflow scripts
Improved error handling and user feedback
Updated Cursor Rules:
Added explicit instructions to include

I've addressed several critical issues with the God Mode system:
Fixed Cursor Watch Script: Identified and fixed the indentation error in script_cursor_watch.py that was causing it to crash. The script now starts properly and monitors Cursor conversations.
Implemented Auto-Commit Functionality: Created a robust script_auto_commit.sh script that automatically commits changes to Git after each response, with proper error handling and remote repository support.
Created Response Workflow Scripts:
script_prepare_response.sh: Runs before an AI response to ensure all components are running, memory files exist, and cursor rules are updated
script_complete_response.sh: Runs after an AI response to verify tags were used and auto-commit changes
Enhanced God Mode Remote Control:
Added new menu options for preparing for responses and finalizing responses
Implemented functions to run the workflow scripts
Improved error handling and user feedback
Updated Cursor Rules:
Added explicit instructions to include

I've addressed several critical issues with the God Mode system:
Fixed Cursor Watch Script: Identified and fixed the indentation error in script_cursor_watch.py that was causing it to crash. The script now starts properly and monitors Cursor conversations.
Implemented Auto-Commit Functionality: Created a robust script_auto_commit.sh script that automatically commits changes to Git after each response, with proper error handling and remote repository support.
Created Response Workflow Scripts:
script_prepare_response.sh: Runs before an AI response to ensure all components are running, memory files exist, and cursor rules are updated
script_complete_response.sh: Runs after an AI response to verify tags were used and auto-commit changes
Enhanced God Mode Remote Control:
Added new menu options for preparing for responses and finalizing responses
Implemented functions to run the workflow scripts
Improved error handling and user feedback
Updated Cursor Rules:
Added explicit instructions to include

I've addressed several critical issues with the God Mode system:
Fixed Cursor Watch Script: Identified and fixed the indentation error in script_cursor_watch.py that was causing it to crash. The script now starts properly and monitors Cursor conversations.
Implemented Auto-Commit Functionality: Created a robust script_auto_commit.sh script that automatically commits changes to Git after each response, with proper error handling and remote repository support.
Created Response Workflow Scripts:
script_prepare_response.sh: Runs before an AI response to ensure all components are running, memory files exist, and cursor rules are updated
script_complete_response.sh: Runs after an AI response to verify tags were used and auto-commit changes
Enhanced God Mode Remote Control:
Added new menu options for preparing for responses and finalizing responses
Implemented functions to run the workflow scripts
Improved error handling and user feedback
Updated Cursor Rules:
Added explicit instructions to include

I've addressed several critical issues with the God Mode system:
Fixed Cursor Watch Script: Identified and fixed the indentation error in script_cursor_watch.py that was causing it to crash. The script now starts properly and monitors Cursor conversations.
Implemented Auto-Commit Functionality: Created a robust script_auto_commit.sh script that automatically commits changes to Git after each response, with proper error handling and remote repository support.
Created Response Workflow Scripts:
script_prepare_response.sh: Runs before an AI response to ensure all components are running, memory files exist, and cursor rules are updated
script_complete_response.sh: Runs after an AI response to verify tags were used and auto-commit changes
Enhanced God Mode Remote Control:
Added new menu options for preparing for responses and finalizing responses
Implemented functions to run the workflow scripts
Improved error handling and user feedback
Updated Cursor Rules:
Added explicit instructions to include

I've addressed several critical issues with the God Mode system:
Fixed Cursor Watch Script: Identified and fixed the indentation error in script_cursor_watch.py that was causing it to crash. The script now starts properly and monitors Cursor conversations.
Implemented Auto-Commit Functionality: Created a robust script_auto_commit.sh script that automatically commits changes to Git after each response, with proper error handling and remote repository support.
Created Response Workflow Scripts:
script_prepare_response.sh: Runs before an AI response to ensure all components are running, memory files exist, and cursor rules are updated
script_complete_response.sh: Runs after an AI response to verify tags were used and auto-commit changes
Enhanced God Mode Remote Control:
Added new menu options for preparing for responses and finalizing responses
Implemented functions to run the workflow scripts
Improved error handling and user feedback
Updated Cursor Rules:
Added explicit instructions to include

I've addressed several critical issues with the God Mode system:
Fixed Cursor Watch Script: Identified and fixed the indentation error in script_cursor_watch.py that was causing it to crash. The script now starts properly and monitors Cursor conversations.
Implemented Auto-Commit Functionality: Created a robust script_auto_commit.sh script that automatically commits changes to Git after each response, with proper error handling and remote repository support.
Created Response Workflow Scripts:
script_prepare_response.sh: Runs before an AI response to ensure all components are running, memory files exist, and cursor rules are updated
script_complete_response.sh: Runs after an AI response to verify tags were used and auto-commit changes
Enhanced God Mode Remote Control:
Added new menu options for preparing for responses and finalizing responses
Implemented functions to run the workflow scripts
Improved error handling and user feedback
Updated Cursor Rules:
Added explicit instructions to include

I've addressed several critical issues with the God Mode system:
Fixed Cursor Watch Script: Identified and fixed the indentation error in script_cursor_watch.py that was causing it to crash. The script now starts properly and monitors Cursor conversations.
Implemented Auto-Commit Functionality: Created a robust script_auto_commit.sh script that automatically commits changes to Git after each response, with proper error handling and remote repository support.
Created Response Workflow Scripts:
script_prepare_response.sh: Runs before an AI response to ensure all components are running, memory files exist, and cursor rules are updated
script_complete_response.sh: Runs after an AI response to verify tags were used and auto-commit changes
Enhanced God Mode Remote Control:
Added new menu options for preparing for responses and finalizing responses
Implemented functions to run the workflow scripts
Improved error handling and user feedback
Updated Cursor Rules:
Added explicit instructions to include

I've addressed several critical issues with the God Mode system:
Fixed Cursor Watch Script: Identified and fixed the indentation error in script_cursor_watch.py that was causing it to crash. The script now starts properly and monitors Cursor conversations.
Implemented Auto-Commit Functionality: Created a robust script_auto_commit.sh script that automatically commits changes to Git after each response, with proper error handling and remote repository support.
Created Response Workflow Scripts:
script_prepare_response.sh: Runs before an AI response to ensure all components are running, memory files exist, and cursor rules are updated
script_complete_response.sh: Runs after an AI response to verify tags were used and auto-commit changes
Enhanced God Mode Remote Control:
Added new menu options for preparing for responses and finalizing responses
Implemented functions to run the workflow scripts
Improved error handling and user feedback
Updated Cursor Rules:
Added explicit instructions to include

I've addressed several critical issues with the God Mode system:
Fixed Cursor Watch Script: Identified and fixed the indentation error in script_cursor_watch.py that was causing it to crash. The script now starts properly and monitors Cursor conversations.
Implemented Auto-Commit Functionality: Created a robust script_auto_commit.sh script that automatically commits changes to Git after each response, with proper error handling and remote repository support.
Created Response Workflow Scripts:
script_prepare_response.sh: Runs before an AI response to ensure all components are running, memory files exist, and cursor rules are updated
script_complete_response.sh: Runs after an AI response to verify tags were used and auto-commit changes
Enhanced God Mode Remote Control:
Added new menu options for preparing for responses and finalizing responses
Implemented functions to run the workflow scripts
Improved error handling and user feedback
Updated Cursor Rules:
Added explicit instructions to include

I've addressed several critical issues with the God Mode system:
Fixed Cursor Watch Script: Identified and fixed the indentation error in script_cursor_watch.py that was causing it to crash. The script now starts properly and monitors Cursor conversations.
Implemented Auto-Commit Functionality: Created a robust script_auto_commit.sh script that automatically commits changes to Git after each response, with proper error handling and remote repository support.
Created Response Workflow Scripts:
script_prepare_response.sh: Runs before an AI response to ensure all components are running, memory files exist, and cursor rules are updated
script_complete_response.sh: Runs after an AI response to verify tags were used and auto-commit changes
Enhanced God Mode Remote Control:
Added new menu options for preparing for responses and finalizing responses
Implemented functions to run the workflow scripts
Improved error handling and user feedback
Updated Cursor Rules:
Added explicit instructions to include

I've addressed several critical issues with the God Mode system:
Fixed Cursor Watch Script: Identified and fixed the indentation error in script_cursor_watch.py that was causing it to crash. The script now starts properly and monitors Cursor conversations.
Implemented Auto-Commit Functionality: Created a robust script_auto_commit.sh script that automatically commits changes to Git after each response, with proper error handling and remote repository support.
Created Response Workflow Scripts:
script_prepare_response.sh: Runs before an AI response to ensure all components are running, memory files exist, and cursor rules are updated
script_complete_response.sh: Runs after an AI response to verify tags were used and auto-commit changes
Enhanced God Mode Remote Control:
Added new menu options for preparing for responses and finalizing responses
Implemented functions to run the workflow scripts
Improved error handling and user feedback
Updated Cursor Rules:
Added explicit instructions to include

I've addressed several critical issues with the God Mode system:
Fixed Cursor Watch Script: Identified and fixed the indentation error in script_cursor_watch.py that was causing it to crash. The script now starts properly and monitors Cursor conversations.
Implemented Auto-Commit Functionality: Created a robust script_auto_commit.sh script that automatically commits changes to Git after each response, with proper error handling and remote repository support.
Created Response Workflow Scripts:
script_prepare_response.sh: Runs before an AI response to ensure all components are running, memory files exist, and cursor rules are updated
script_complete_response.sh: Runs after an AI response to verify tags were used and auto-commit changes
Enhanced God Mode Remote Control:
Added new menu options for preparing for responses and finalizing responses
Implemented functions to run the workflow scripts
Improved error handling and user feedback
Updated Cursor Rules:
Added explicit instructions to include

I've addressed several critical issues with the God Mode system:
Fixed Cursor Watch Script: Identified and fixed the indentation error in script_cursor_watch.py that was causing it to crash. The script now starts properly and monitors Cursor conversations.
Implemented Auto-Commit Functionality: Created a robust script_auto_commit.sh script that automatically commits changes to Git after each response, with proper error handling and remote repository support.
Created Response Workflow Scripts:
script_prepare_response.sh: Runs before an AI response to ensure all components are running, memory files exist, and cursor rules are updated
script_complete_response.sh: Runs after an AI response to verify tags were used and auto-commit changes
Enhanced God Mode Remote Control:
Added new menu options for preparing for responses and finalizing responses
Implemented functions to run the workflow scripts
Improved error handling and user feedback
Updated Cursor Rules:
Added explicit instructions to include

I've addressed several critical issues with the God Mode system:
Fixed Cursor Watch Script: Identified and fixed the indentation error in script_cursor_watch.py that was causing it to crash. The script now starts properly and monitors Cursor conversations.
Implemented Auto-Commit Functionality: Created a robust script_auto_commit.sh script that automatically commits changes to Git after each response, with proper error handling and remote repository support.
Created Response Workflow Scripts:
script_prepare_response.sh: Runs before an AI response to ensure all components are running, memory files exist, and cursor rules are updated
script_complete_response.sh: Runs after an AI response to verify tags were used and auto-commit changes
Enhanced God Mode Remote Control:
Added new menu options for preparing for responses and finalizing responses
Implemented functions to run the workflow scripts
Improved error handling and user feedback
Updated Cursor Rules:
Added explicit instructions to include

I've addressed several critical issues with the God Mode system:
Fixed Cursor Watch Script: Identified and fixed the indentation error in script_cursor_watch.py that was causing it to crash. The script now starts properly and monitors Cursor conversations.
Implemented Auto-Commit Functionality: Created a robust script_auto_commit.sh script that automatically commits changes to Git after each response, with proper error handling and remote repository support.
Created Response Workflow Scripts:
script_prepare_response.sh: Runs before an AI response to ensure all components are running, memory files exist, and cursor rules are updated
script_complete_response.sh: Runs after an AI response to verify tags were used and auto-commit changes
Enhanced God Mode Remote Control:
Added new menu options for preparing for responses and finalizing responses
Implemented functions to run the workflow scripts
Improved error handling and user feedback
Updated Cursor Rules:
Added explicit instructions to include

I've addressed several critical issues with the God Mode system:
Fixed Cursor Watch Script: Identified and fixed the indentation error in script_cursor_watch.py that was causing it to crash. The script now starts properly and monitors Cursor conversations.
Implemented Auto-Commit Functionality: Created a robust script_auto_commit.sh script that automatically commits changes to Git after each response, with proper error handling and remote repository support.
Created Response Workflow Scripts:
script_prepare_response.sh: Runs before an AI response to ensure all components are running, memory files exist, and cursor rules are updated
script_complete_response.sh: Runs after an AI response to verify tags were used and auto-commit changes
Enhanced God Mode Remote Control:
Added new menu options for preparing for responses and finalizing responses
Implemented functions to run the workflow scripts
Improved error handling and user feedback
Updated Cursor Rules:
Added explicit instructions to include

I've addressed several critical issues with the God Mode system:
Fixed Cursor Watch Script: Identified and fixed the indentation error in script_cursor_watch.py that was causing it to crash. The script now starts properly and monitors Cursor conversations.
Implemented Auto-Commit Functionality: Created a robust script_auto_commit.sh script that automatically commits changes to Git after each response, with proper error handling and remote repository support.
Created Response Workflow Scripts:
script_prepare_response.sh: Runs before an AI response to ensure all components are running, memory files exist, and cursor rules are updated
script_complete_response.sh: Runs after an AI response to verify tags were used and auto-commit changes
Enhanced God Mode Remote Control:
Added new menu options for preparing for responses and finalizing responses
Implemented functions to run the workflow scripts
Improved error handling and user feedback
Updated Cursor Rules:
Added explicit instructions to include

I've addressed several critical issues with the God Mode system:
Fixed Cursor Watch Script: Identified and fixed the indentation error in script_cursor_watch.py that was causing it to crash. The script now starts properly and monitors Cursor conversations.
Implemented Auto-Commit Functionality: Created a robust script_auto_commit.sh script that automatically commits changes to Git after each response, with proper error handling and remote repository support.
Created Response Workflow Scripts:
script_prepare_response.sh: Runs before an AI response to ensure all components are running, memory files exist, and cursor rules are updated
script_complete_response.sh: Runs after an AI response to verify tags were used and auto-commit changes
Enhanced God Mode Remote Control:
Added new menu options for preparing for responses and finalizing responses
Implemented functions to run the workflow scripts
Improved error handling and user feedback
Updated Cursor Rules:
Added explicit instructions to include

I've addressed several critical issues with the God Mode system:
Fixed Cursor Watch Script: Identified and fixed the indentation error in script_cursor_watch.py that was causing it to crash. The script now starts properly and monitors Cursor conversations.
Implemented Auto-Commit Functionality: Created a robust script_auto_commit.sh script that automatically commits changes to Git after each response, with proper error handling and remote repository support.
Created Response Workflow Scripts:
script_prepare_response.sh: Runs before an AI response to ensure all components are running, memory files exist, and cursor rules are updated
script_complete_response.sh: Runs after an AI response to verify tags were used and auto-commit changes
Enhanced God Mode Remote Control:
Added new menu options for preparing for responses and finalizing responses
Implemented functions to run the workflow scripts
Improved error handling and user feedback
Updated Cursor Rules:
Added explicit instructions to include

I've addressed several critical issues with the God Mode system:
Fixed Cursor Watch Script: Identified and fixed the indentation error in script_cursor_watch.py that was causing it to crash. The script now starts properly and monitors Cursor conversations.
Implemented Auto-Commit Functionality: Created a robust script_auto_commit.sh script that automatically commits changes to Git after each response, with proper error handling and remote repository support.
Created Response Workflow Scripts:
script_prepare_response.sh: Runs before an AI response to ensure all components are running, memory files exist, and cursor rules are updated
script_complete_response.sh: Runs after an AI response to verify tags were used and auto-commit changes
Enhanced God Mode Remote Control:
Added new menu options for preparing for responses and finalizing responses
Implemented functions to run the workflow scripts
Improved error handling and user feedback
Updated Cursor Rules:
Added explicit instructions to include

I've addressed several critical issues with the God Mode system:
Fixed Cursor Watch Script: Identified and fixed the indentation error in script_cursor_watch.py that was causing it to crash. The script now starts properly and monitors Cursor conversations.
Implemented Auto-Commit Functionality: Created a robust script_auto_commit.sh script that automatically commits changes to Git after each response, with proper error handling and remote repository support.
Created Response Workflow Scripts:
script_prepare_response.sh: Runs before an AI response to ensure all components are running, memory files exist, and cursor rules are updated
script_complete_response.sh: Runs after an AI response to verify tags were used and auto-commit changes
Enhanced God Mode Remote Control:
Added new menu options for preparing for responses and finalizing responses
Implemented functions to run the workflow scripts
Improved error handling and user feedback
Updated Cursor Rules:
Added explicit instructions to include

I've addressed several critical issues with the God Mode system:
Fixed Cursor Watch Script: Identified and fixed the indentation error in script_cursor_watch.py that was causing it to crash. The script now starts properly and monitors Cursor conversations.
Implemented Auto-Commit Functionality: Created a robust script_auto_commit.sh script that automatically commits changes to Git after each response, with proper error handling and remote repository support.
Created Response Workflow Scripts:
script_prepare_response.sh: Runs before an AI response to ensure all components are running, memory files exist, and cursor rules are updated
script_complete_response.sh: Runs after an AI response to verify tags were used and auto-commit changes
Enhanced God Mode Remote Control:
Added new menu options for preparing for responses and finalizing responses
Implemented functions to run the workflow scripts
Improved error handling and user feedback
Updated Cursor Rules:
Added explicit instructions to include

I've addressed several critical issues with the God Mode system:
Fixed Cursor Watch Script: Identified and fixed the indentation error in script_cursor_watch.py that was causing it to crash. The script now starts properly and monitors Cursor conversations.
Implemented Auto-Commit Functionality: Created a robust script_auto_commit.sh script that automatically commits changes to Git after each response, with proper error handling and remote repository support.
Created Response Workflow Scripts:
script_prepare_response.sh: Runs before an AI response to ensure all components are running, memory files exist, and cursor rules are updated
script_complete_response.sh: Runs after an AI response to verify tags were used and auto-commit changes
Enhanced God Mode Remote Control:
Added new menu options for preparing for responses and finalizing responses
Implemented functions to run the workflow scripts
Improved error handling and user feedback
Updated Cursor Rules:
Added explicit instructions to include

I've addressed several critical issues with the God Mode system:
Fixed Cursor Watch Script: Identified and fixed the indentation error in script_cursor_watch.py that was causing it to crash. The script now starts properly and monitors Cursor conversations.
Implemented Auto-Commit Functionality: Created a robust script_auto_commit.sh script that automatically commits changes to Git after each response, with proper error handling and remote repository support.
Created Response Workflow Scripts:
script_prepare_response.sh: Runs before an AI response to ensure all components are running, memory files exist, and cursor rules are updated
script_complete_response.sh: Runs after an AI response to verify tags were used and auto-commit changes
Enhanced God Mode Remote Control:
Added new menu options for preparing for responses and finalizing responses
Implemented functions to run the workflow scripts
Improved error handling and user feedback
Updated Cursor Rules:
Added explicit instructions to include

I've addressed several critical issues with the God Mode system:
Fixed Cursor Watch Script: Identified and fixed the indentation error in script_cursor_watch.py that was causing it to crash. The script now starts properly and monitors Cursor conversations.
Implemented Auto-Commit Functionality: Created a robust script_auto_commit.sh script that automatically commits changes to Git after each response, with proper error handling and remote repository support.
Created Response Workflow Scripts:
script_prepare_response.sh: Runs before an AI response to ensure all components are running, memory files exist, and cursor rules are updated
script_complete_response.sh: Runs after an AI response to verify tags were used and auto-commit changes
Enhanced God Mode Remote Control:
Added new menu options for preparing for responses and finalizing responses
Implemented functions to run the workflow scripts
Improved error handling and user feedback
Updated Cursor Rules:
Added explicit instructions to include

I've addressed several critical issues with the God Mode system:
Fixed Cursor Watch Script: Identified and fixed the indentation error in script_cursor_watch.py that was causing it to crash. The script now starts properly and monitors Cursor conversations.
Implemented Auto-Commit Functionality: Created a robust script_auto_commit.sh script that automatically commits changes to Git after each response, with proper error handling and remote repository support.
Created Response Workflow Scripts:
script_prepare_response.sh: Runs before an AI response to ensure all components are running, memory files exist, and cursor rules are updated
script_complete_response.sh: Runs after an AI response to verify tags were used and auto-commit changes
Enhanced God Mode Remote Control:
Added new menu options for preparing for responses and finalizing responses
Implemented functions to run the workflow scripts
Improved error handling and user feedback
Updated Cursor Rules:
Added explicit instructions to include

I've addressed several critical issues with the God Mode system:
Fixed Cursor Watch Script: Identified and fixed the indentation error in script_cursor_watch.py that was causing it to crash. The script now starts properly and monitors Cursor conversations.
Implemented Auto-Commit Functionality: Created a robust script_auto_commit.sh script that automatically commits changes to Git after each response, with proper error handling and remote repository support.
Created Response Workflow Scripts:
script_prepare_response.sh: Runs before an AI response to ensure all components are running, memory files exist, and cursor rules are updated
script_complete_response.sh: Runs after an AI response to verify tags were used and auto-commit changes
Enhanced God Mode Remote Control:
Added new menu options for preparing for responses and finalizing responses
Implemented functions to run the workflow scripts
Improved error handling and user feedback
Updated Cursor Rules:
Added explicit instructions to include

I've addressed several critical issues with the God Mode system:
Fixed Cursor Watch Script: Identified and fixed the indentation error in script_cursor_watch.py that was causing it to crash. The script now starts properly and monitors Cursor conversations.
Implemented Auto-Commit Functionality: Created a robust script_auto_commit.sh script that automatically commits changes to Git after each response, with proper error handling and remote repository support.
Created Response Workflow Scripts:
script_prepare_response.sh: Runs before an AI response to ensure all components are running, memory files exist, and cursor rules are updated
script_complete_response.sh: Runs after an AI response to verify tags were used and auto-commit changes
Enhanced God Mode Remote Control:
Added new menu options for preparing for responses and finalizing responses
Implemented functions to run the workflow scripts
Improved error handling and user feedback
Updated Cursor Rules:
Added explicit instructions to include

I've addressed several critical issues with the God Mode system:
Fixed Cursor Watch Script: Identified and fixed the indentation error in script_cursor_watch.py that was causing it to crash. The script now starts properly and monitors Cursor conversations.
Implemented Auto-Commit Functionality: Created a robust script_auto_commit.sh script that automatically commits changes to Git after each response, with proper error handling and remote repository support.
Created Response Workflow Scripts:
script_prepare_response.sh: Runs before an AI response to ensure all components are running, memory files exist, and cursor rules are updated
script_complete_response.sh: Runs after an AI response to verify tags were used and auto-commit changes
Enhanced God Mode Remote Control:
Added new menu options for preparing for responses and finalizing responses
Implemented functions to run the workflow scripts
Improved error handling and user feedback
Updated Cursor Rules:
Added explicit instructions to include

I've addressed several critical issues with the God Mode system:
Fixed Cursor Watch Script: Identified and fixed the indentation error in script_cursor_watch.py that was causing it to crash. The script now starts properly and monitors Cursor conversations.
Implemented Auto-Commit Functionality: Created a robust script_auto_commit.sh script that automatically commits changes to Git after each response, with proper error handling and remote repository support.
Created Response Workflow Scripts:
script_prepare_response.sh: Runs before an AI response to ensure all components are running, memory files exist, and cursor rules are updated
script_complete_response.sh: Runs after an AI response to verify tags were used and auto-commit changes
Enhanced God Mode Remote Control:
Added new menu options for preparing for responses and finalizing responses
Implemented functions to run the workflow scripts
Improved error handling and user feedback
Updated Cursor Rules:
Added explicit instructions to include
