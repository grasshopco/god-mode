# Cursor IDE "God Mode" Implementation Plan

<brainstorming>
This plan will implement all the advanced features discussed in the research report for turning Cursor IDE into a supercharged AI programming assistant. Looking at the file, I need to organize this into logical sections that build on each other:

1. First, we'll set up the core configuration files and memory systems
2. Then implement the logging and learning mechanisms
3. Set up project structure tracking and file organization
4. Configure advanced AI features like autonomous coding
5. Set up external integrations and automation tools
6. Implement continuous improvement systems

Each step should be atomic and focus on implementing a specific feature of the "God Mode" system.

## Summary

This implementation plan provides a comprehensive approach to setting up Cursor IDE in "God Mode," transforming it from a simple AI coding assistant into an autonomous development partner. The plan is organized into logical sections, starting with core configuration and memory systems, then progressively adding logging mechanisms, project structure tracking, autonomous coding features, quality assurance tools, advanced integrations, and continuous improvement systems.

By following this plan, you'll create a robust ecosystem where the AI can:
- Maintain persistent memory of your project's architecture and decisions
- Automatically log all changes in both summary and detailed formats
- Track the project structure and adapt to its evolution
- Work autonomously with minimal human intervention
- Maintain high code quality through automated testing and self-review
- Integrate with external tools and documentation
- Continuously improve its own performance

The resulting system will dramatically reduce manual coding effort, allowing you to focus on high-level design decisions while the AI handles implementation details. Remember that with great power comes great responsibility - particularly when enabling features like YOLO mode that allow the AI to make changes without confirmation. Always ensure you have proper version control in place.

To maximize results, you should regularly review the AI's logs, learnings, and memory files to ensure they accurately reflect your project's needs and direction. This collaborative approach will yield the best results, making you truly a "coding god" with AI.
