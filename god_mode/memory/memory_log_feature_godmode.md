Enhanced God Mode with a complete response workflow system that ensures proper tagging and Git integration. Fixed the Cursor Watch script to properly monitor conversations, implemented auto-commit functionality, and created scripts that run before and after AI responses to maintain system integrity. Added menu options to the remote control script for managing the response workflow.

I noticed you're still doing the TAG stuff with the brackets rather than the XML style wth the blocks:
<feature X> <feature Y> 
stuff
</feature X> <feature Y>

looks like @.cursorrules werent properly updated to accommodate this. why are you not properly implementing the stuff? Also, why did the script not be done at the very end of your response? Am I misunderstanding the way the script is supposed to work? I want you to give me a bulleted number to list of exactly how everything is supposed to work and then you're gonna cross compared to see what's actually happening in comparison to that list so we can see what's going wrong and I think if we can get really nitty-gritty detail and make sure we follow this file @prompt_future_proofing_plan.md we wont' run into issues, also why did you stop doing the planning roadmap stuff? this should all be DONE EVERY TIME BECAUSE YOU SHOULD BE RUNNING A SCRIPT OR INSTRUCTIONS IN YOUR CURSOR RULES FILE THAT GIVE YOU STEP BY STEP INSTRUCTIONS OF EXACTLY HOW ALL YOUR RESPONSES NEED TO BE E SO YOU FOLLOW IT PERFECTLY EVERY TIME

project roadmaps look like this @roadmap_god_mode_03_04_345am.md @roadmap_god_mode_implementation_progress_update_20250304_095506.md there are supposed to be scripts for this in @scripts but the issue seems to be that you dont have the @.cursorrules set up to give you the exact step by step of what should be done every single time

THE HIGHEST PRIORITY IS TO GIVE ME A STEP BY STEP LIST OF HOW EVERYTHING IS SUPPOSED TO BE AND I WILL TELL YOU IF IT IS CORRECT OR NOT THEN THE NEXT PRIORITY IS FIXING THE CURSOR RULES FILE WHICH IS CAUSING YOU TO DO THE TAGS WRONG AGAIN

Thought Process
I'll provide a comprehensive breakdown of how the God Mode system should work and then analyze where we're having issues.
Step-by-Step Guide to God Mode System
Response Structure Workflow
Before each AI response, script_prepare_response.sh should be run to:
Check if Cursor Watch is running (start if not)
Check if Message Router is running (start if not)
Update project structure
Verify memory files exist
Update Cursor rules
AI responses should include XML-style tags (not bracket-style) with this structure:
>
After each AI response, script_complete_response.sh should run to:
Check if tags were properly included
Auto-commit changes to git
Verify all components are running
The Message Router should process these XML-style tags and route content to appropriate files
What's Actually Happening

Enhanced God Mode with a complete response workflow system that ensures proper tagging and Git integration. Fixed the Cursor Watch script to properly monitor conversations, implemented auto-commit functionality, and created scripts that run before and after AI responses to maintain system integrity. Added menu options to the remote control script for managing the response workflow.

I noticed you're still doing the TAG stuff with the brackets rather than the XML style wth the blocks:
<feature X> <feature Y> 
stuff
</feature X> <feature Y>

looks like @.cursorrules werent properly updated to accommodate this. why are you not properly implementing the stuff? Also, why did the script not be done at the very end of your response? Am I misunderstanding the way the script is supposed to work? I want you to give me a bulleted number to list of exactly how everything is supposed to work and then you're gonna cross compared to see what's actually happening in comparison to that list so we can see what's going wrong and I think if we can get really nitty-gritty detail and make sure we follow this file @prompt_future_proofing_plan.md we wont' run into issues, also why did you stop doing the planning roadmap stuff? this should all be DONE EVERY TIME BECAUSE YOU SHOULD BE RUNNING A SCRIPT OR INSTRUCTIONS IN YOUR CURSOR RULES FILE THAT GIVE YOU STEP BY STEP INSTRUCTIONS OF EXACTLY HOW ALL YOUR RESPONSES NEED TO BE E SO YOU FOLLOW IT PERFECTLY EVERY TIME

project roadmaps look like this @roadmap_god_mode_03_04_345am.md @roadmap_god_mode_implementation_progress_update_20250304_095506.md there are supposed to be scripts for this in @scripts but the issue seems to be that you dont have the @.cursorrules set up to give you the exact step by step of what should be done every single time

THE HIGHEST PRIORITY IS TO GIVE ME A STEP BY STEP LIST OF HOW EVERYTHING IS SUPPOSED TO BE AND I WILL TELL YOU IF IT IS CORRECT OR NOT THEN THE NEXT PRIORITY IS FIXING THE CURSOR RULES FILE WHICH IS CAUSING YOU TO DO THE TAGS WRONG AGAIN

Thought Process
I'll provide a comprehensive breakdown of how the God Mode system should work and then analyze where we're having issues.
