# Cursor Memory: Project Context

This document serves as a persistent memory for the AI assistant, providing context across coding sessions for the project. It contains key architectural decisions, patterns, and important information that should be referenced before starting new work.

## Project Overview

This is a project template using the God Mode enhancement for Cursor IDE. Replace this overview with a description of your project, including its purpose, goals, and main features.

*Replace this section with your project's specific details.*

## Core Architecture

This project follows the architecture described below:

- **Frontend**: *Describe your frontend technology stack*
- **Backend**: *Describe your backend technology stack*
- **Database**: *Describe your database technology*
- **Authentication**: *Describe your authentication method*
- **State Management**: *Describe your state management approach*
- **Styling**: *Describe your styling approach*

*Replace the above items with your project's specific architecture.*

## Key Decisions

This section will be updated as important architectural and technical decisions are made throughout development.

| Datetime | Decision | Reasoning | Implications |
|------|----------|-----------|--------------|
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS | Initial setup of Cursor God Mode | Enable more autonomous and efficient AI assistance | Creation of memory and logging systems to enhance AI context awareness |

*Add your project-specific decisions to this table as development progresses.*

## Coding Standards

- *List your primary programming language(s)*
- *Describe your preferred programming paradigm*
- *Note component/module structure preferences*
- *Specify state management guidelines*
- *Document API/database interaction patterns*
- *Add security considerations*

*Replace with your project's specific coding standards.*

## Common Patterns

- *Describe data fetching patterns*
- *Document component/module composition patterns*
- *Specify error handling approaches*
- *Note authentication flow patterns*

*Replace with your project's specific patterns.*

## Integration Points

- *List external services and APIs*
- *Document internal system integration points*
- *Note styling/theming integration*

*Replace with your project's specific integration points.*
